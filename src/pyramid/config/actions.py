           framework extension authors, not by :app:`Pyramid` application

        The ``discriminator`` uniquely identifies the action.  It must be
        given, but it can be ``None``, to indicate that the action never
        conflicts.  It must be a hashable value.

        The ``callable`` is a callable object which performs the task
        associated with the action when the action is executed.  It is
        optional.

        ``args`` and ``kw`` are tuple and dict objects respectively, which
        are passed to ``callable`` when this action is executed.  Both are
        optional.

        ``order`` is a grouping mechanism; an action with a lower order will
        be executed before an action with a higher order (has no effect when
        autocommit is ``True``).

        ``introspectables`` is a sequence of :term:`introspectable` objects
        (or the empty sequence if no introspectable objects are associated
        with this action).  If this configurator's ``introspection``
        attribute is ``False``, these introspectables will be ignored.

        ``extra`` provides a facility for inserting extra keys and values
        into an action dictionary.
