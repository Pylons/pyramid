    """
    A Configurator is used to configure a :app:`Pyramid`
    :term:`application registry`.

    The Configurator lifecycle can be managed by using a context manager to
    automatically handle calling :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.begin` and
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.end` as well as
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.commit`.

    .. code-block:: python

        with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
            config.add_route('home', '/')
            app = config.make_wsgi_app()

    If the ``registry`` argument is not ``None``, it must
    be an instance of the :class:`pyramid.registry.Registry` class
    representing the registry to configure.  If ``registry`` is ``None``, the
    configurator will create a :class:`pyramid.registry.Registry` instance
    itself; it will also perform some default configuration that would not
    otherwise be done.  After its construction, the configurator may be used
    to add further configuration to the registry.

    .. warning:: If ``registry`` is assigned the above-mentioned class
       instance, all other constructor arguments are ignored,
       with the exception of ``package``.

    If the ``package`` argument is passed, it must be a reference to a Python
    :term:`package` (e.g. ``sys.modules['thepackage']``) or a :term:`dotted
    Python name` to the same.  This value is used as a basis to convert
    relative paths passed to various configuration methods, such as methods
    which accept a ``renderer`` argument, into absolute paths.  If ``None``
    is passed (the default), the package is assumed to be the Python package
    in which the *caller* of the ``Configurator`` constructor lives.

    If the ``root_package`` is passed, it will propagate through the
    configuration hierarchy as a way for included packages to locate
    resources relative to the package in which the main ``Configurator`` was
    created. If ``None`` is passed (the default), the ``root_package`` will
    be derived from the ``package`` argument. The ``package`` attribute is
    always pointing at the package being included when using :meth:`.include`,
    whereas the ``root_package`` does not change.

    If the ``settings`` argument is passed, it should be a Python dictionary
    representing the :term:`deployment settings` for this application.  These
    are later retrievable using the
    :attr:`pyramid.registry.Registry.settings` attribute (aka
    ``request.registry.settings``).

    If the ``root_factory`` argument is passed, it should be an object
    representing the default :term:`root factory` for your application or a
    :term:`dotted Python name` to the same.  If it is ``None``, a default
    root factory will be used.

    If ``authentication_policy`` is passed, it should be an instance
    of an :term:`authentication policy` or a :term:`dotted Python
    name` to the same.

    If ``authorization_policy`` is passed, it should be an instance of
    an :term:`authorization policy` or a :term:`dotted Python name` to
    the same.

    .. note:: A ``ConfigurationError`` will be raised when an
       authorization policy is supplied without also supplying an
       authentication policy (authorization requires authentication).

    If ``renderers`` is ``None`` (the default), a default set of
    :term:`renderer` factories is used. Else, it should be a list of
    tuples representing a set of renderer factories which should be
    configured into this application, and each tuple representing a set of
    positional values that should be passed to
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_renderer`.

    If ``debug_logger`` is not passed, a default debug logger that logs to a
    logger will be used (the logger name will be the package name of the
    *caller* of this configurator).  If it is passed, it should be an
    instance of the :class:`logging.Logger` (PEP 282) standard library class
    or a Python logger name.  The debug logger is used by :app:`Pyramid`
    itself to log warnings and authorization debugging information.

    If ``locale_negotiator`` is passed, it should be a :term:`locale
    negotiator` implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to
    same.  See :ref:`custom_locale_negotiator`.

    If ``request_factory`` is passed, it should be a :term:`request
    factory` implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to the same.
    See :ref:`changing_the_request_factory`.  By default it is ``None``,
    which means use the default request factory.

    If ``response_factory`` is passed, it should be a :term:`response
    factory` implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to the same.
    See :ref:`changing_the_response_factory`.  By default it is ``None``,
    which means use the default response factory.

    If ``default_permission`` is passed, it should be a
    :term:`permission` string to be used as the default permission for
    all view configuration registrations performed against this
    Configurator.  An example of a permission string:``'view'``.
    Adding a default permission makes it unnecessary to protect each
    view configuration with an explicit permission, unless your
    application policy requires some exception for a particular view.
    By default, ``default_permission`` is ``None``, meaning that view
    configurations which do not explicitly declare a permission will
    always be executable by entirely anonymous users (any
    authorization policy in effect is ignored).

    .. seealso::

        See also :ref:`setting_a_default_permission`.

    If ``session_factory`` is passed, it should be an object which
    implements the :term:`session factory` interface.  If a nondefault
    value is passed, the ``session_factory`` will be used to create a
    session object when ``request.session`` is accessed.  Note that
    the same outcome can be achieved by calling
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_session_factory`.  By
    default, this argument is ``None``, indicating that no session
    factory will be configured (and thus accessing ``request.session``
    will throw an error) unless ``set_session_factory`` is called later
    during configuration.

    If ``autocommit`` is ``True``, every method called on the configurator
    will cause an immediate action, and no configuration conflict detection
    will be used. If ``autocommit`` is ``False``, most methods of the
    configurator will defer their action until
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.commit` is called.  When
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.commit` is called, the actions implied
    by the called methods will be checked for configuration conflicts unless
    ``autocommit`` is ``True``.  If a conflict is detected, a
    ``ConfigurationConflictError`` will be raised.  Calling
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.make_wsgi_app` always implies a final
    commit.

    If ``default_view_mapper`` is passed, it will be used as the default
    :term:`view mapper` factory for view configurations that don't otherwise
    specify one (see :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IViewMapperFactory`).  If
    ``default_view_mapper`` is not passed, a superdefault view mapper will be
    used.

    If ``exceptionresponse_view`` is passed, it must be a :term:`view
    callable` or ``None``.  If it is a view callable, it will be used as an
    exception view callable when an :term:`exception response` is raised. If
    ``exceptionresponse_view`` is ``None``, no exception response view will
    be registered, and all raised exception responses will be bubbled up to
    Pyramid's caller.  By
    default, the ``pyramid.httpexceptions.default_exceptionresponse_view``
    function is used as the ``exceptionresponse_view``.

    If ``route_prefix`` is passed, all routes added with
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route` will have the specified path
    prepended to their pattern.

    If ``introspection`` is passed, it must be a boolean value.  If it's
    ``True``, introspection values during actions will be kept for use
    for tools like the debug toolbar.  If it's ``False``, introspection
    values provided by registrations will be ignored.  By default, it is
    ``True``.

            function accepted ``*callables``, but this has been changed
            to support only a single callable.

        A configuration callable should be a callable that accepts a single
        argument named ``config``, which will be an instance of a
        :term:`Configurator`.  However, be warned that it will not be the same
        configurator instance on which you call this method.  The
        code which runs as a result of calling the callable should invoke
        methods on the configurator passed to it which add configuration
        state.  The return value of a callable will be ignored.

        Values allowed to be presented via the ``callable`` argument to
        this method: any callable Python object or any :term:`dotted Python
        name` which resolves to a callable Python object.  It may also be a
        Python :term:`module`, in which case, the module will be searched for
        a callable named ``includeme``, which will be treated as the
        configuration callable.

        For example, if the ``includeme`` function below lives in a module
        named ``myapp.myconfig``:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           # myapp.myconfig module

           def my_view(request):

           def includeme(config):

        You might cause it to be included within your Pyramid application like
        so:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           from pyramid.config import Configurator

           def main(global_config, **settings):

               config.include('myapp.myconfig.includeme')

        Because the function is named ``includeme``, the function name can
        also be omitted from the dotted name reference:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           from pyramid.config import Configurator

           def main(global_config, **settings):
               config = Configurator()
               config.include('myapp.myconfig')

        Included configuration statements will be overridden by local
        configuration statements if an included callable causes a
        configuration conflict by registering something with the same
        configuration parameters.

        If the ``route_prefix`` is supplied, it must be a string and will
        have a similar effect to using
        :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.route_prefix_context`.  Any calls
        to :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route` within the included
        callable will have their pattern prefixed with the value of
        ``route_prefix``. This can be used to help mount a set of routes at a
        different location than the included callable's author intended, while
        still maintaining the same route names.  For example:

        .. code-block:: python
           :linenos:

           from pyramid.config import Configurator

           def included(config):
               config.add_route('show_users', '/show')

           def main(global_config, **settings):
               config = Configurator()
               config.include(included, route_prefix='/users')

        In the above configuration, the ``show_users`` route will have an
        effective route pattern of ``/users/show``, instead of ``/show``
        because the ``route_prefix`` argument will be prepended to the
        pattern.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           The ``route_prefix`` parameter.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.9
           The included function is wrapped with a call to
           :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.begin` and
           :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.end` while it is executed.

        The ``package`` argument should be a Python :term:`package` or module
        object (or a :term:`dotted Python name` which refers to such a
        package or module).  If ``package`` is ``None``, the package of the
        *caller* is used.

        The ``categories`` argument, if provided, should be the
        :term:`Venusian` 'scan categories' to use during scanning.  Providing
        this argument is not often necessary; specifying scan categories is
        an extremely advanced usage.  By default, ``categories`` is ``None``
        which will execute *all* Venusian decorator callbacks including
        :app:`Pyramid`-related decorators such as
        :class:`pyramid.view.view_config`.  See the :term:`Venusian`
        documentation for more information about limiting a scan by using an
        explicit set of categories.

        The ``onerror`` argument, if provided, should be a Venusian
        ``onerror`` callback function.  The onerror function is passed to
        :meth:`venusian.Scanner.scan` to influence error behavior when an
        exception is raised during the scanning process.  See the
        :term:`Venusian` documentation for more information about ``onerror``
        callbacks.

        The ``ignore`` argument, if provided, should be a Venusian ``ignore``
        value.  Providing an ``ignore`` argument allows the scan to ignore
        particular modules, packages, or global objects during a scan.
        ``ignore`` can be a string or a callable, or a list containing
        strings or callables.  The simplest usage of ``ignore`` is to provide
        a module or package by providing a full path to its dotted name.  For
        example: ``config.scan(ignore='my.module.subpackage')`` would ignore
        the ``my.module.subpackage`` package during a scan, which would
        prevent the subpackage and any of its submodules from being imported
        and scanned.  See the :term:`Venusian` documentation for more
        information about the ``ignore`` argument.

        To perform a ``scan``, Pyramid creates a Venusian ``Scanner`` object.
        The ``kw`` argument represents a set of keyword arguments to pass to
        the Venusian ``Scanner`` object's constructor.  See the
        :term:`venusian` documentation (its ``Scanner`` class) for more
        information about the constructor.  By default, the only keyword
        arguments passed to the Scanner constructor are ``{'config':self}``
        where ``self`` is this configurator object.  This services the
        requirement of all built-in Pyramid decorators, but extension systems
        may require additional arguments.  Providing this argument is not
        often necessary; it's an advanced usage.
