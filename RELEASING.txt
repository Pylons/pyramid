Releasing Pyramid
=================

- For clarity, we define releases as follows.

  - Alpha, beta, dev and similar statuses do not qualify whether a release is
    major or minor. The term "pre-release" means alpha, beta, or dev.

  - A release is final when it is no longer pre-release.

  - A *major* release is where the first number either before or after the
    first dot increases. Examples: 1.6 to 1.7a1, or 1.8 to 2.0.

  - A *minor* or *bug fix* release is where the number after the second dot
    increases. Example: 1.6 to 1.6.1.

Prepare new release branch
--------------------------

- Create a new release branch, incrementing the version number.

- Do any necessary branch merges (e.g., master to branch, branch to master).

- On release branch:

  $ git pull

- Do platform test via tox:

  $ tox -r

  Make sure statement coverage is at 100% (the test run will fail if not).

- Run tests on Windows if feasible.

- Make sure all scaffold tests pass (CPython 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, and PyPy
  on UNIX; this doesn't work on Windows):

  $ ./scaffoldtests.sh

- Ensure all features of the release are documented (audit CHANGES.txt or
  communicate with contributors).

- Change CHANGES.txt heading to reflect the new version number.

- Copy relevant changes (delta bug fixes) from CHANGES.txt to
  docs/whatsnew-X.X (if it's a major release).  Minor releases should
  include a link under "Bug Fix Releases" to the minor feature
  changes in CHANGES.txt.

- Update README.rst to use correct versions of badges and URLs according to
  each branch and context, i.e., RTD "latest" == GitHub/Travis "1.x-branch".

- Update whatsnew-X.X.rst in docs to point at change log entries for individual
  releases if applicable.

- For major version releases, in contributing.md, update branch descriptions.

- For major version releases, in docs/conf.py, update values under
  html_theme_options for in_progress and outdated across master, releasing
  branch, and previously released branch. Also in the previously released
  branch only, uncomment the sections to enable pylons_sphinx_latesturl.

- Change setup.py version to the release version number.

- Make sure PyPI long description renders (requires ``collective.dist``
  installed into your Python)::

  $ python setup.py check -r

- Create a release tag.

- Make sure your Python has ``setuptools-git``, ``twine``, and ``wheel``
  installed and release to PyPI::

  $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  $ twine upload dist/pyramid-X.X-*

- Configure RTD to publish the new release version of the docs.

Prepare master for further development (major releases only)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Checkout master.

- In CHANGES.txt, preserve headings but clear out content. Add heading
  "unreleased" for the version number.

- From the release branch, forward port the changes in CHANGES.txt to
  HISTORY.txt.

- In contributing.md, forward port branch descriptions from release branch.

- In docs/conf.py, add a commented line under
  pylons_sphinx_latesturl_pagename_overrides for the release.

- Change setup.py version to the next version number.

Update previous version (final releases only)
---------------------------------------------

- In docs/conf.py, update values under html_theme_options for in_progress and
  outdated. Uncomment the sections to enable pylons_sphinx_latesturl.

- Configure RTD to point the "latest" alias to the new release version of the
  docs.
