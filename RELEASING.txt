Releasing Pyramid
=================

- Do any necessary branch merges (e.g. master to branch, branch to master).

- On release branch:

  $ git pull

- Do platform test via tox:

  $ tox -r

  Make sure statement coverage is at 100%::

- Run Windows tests for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3 if feasible.

  this doesn't work on Windows):

  $ python pyramid/scaffolds/tests.py

- Ensure all features of the release are documented (audit CHANGES.txt or
  communicate with contributors).

- Copy relevant changes (delta bug fixes) from CHANGES.txt to

  $ cd docs
  $ make clean html

  There should be no meaningful errors or warnings.

- Change setup.py version to the new version number.

- Change CHANGES.txt heading to reflect the new version number.

- Make sure PyPI long description renders (requires ``collective.dist``
  installed into your Python)::

  $ python setup.py check -r

- Create a release tag.

- Make sure your system Python has ``setuptools-git`` installed and release to
  PyPI::

  $ python setup.py sdist register upload

- Edit `http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks
  <http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>`_.
