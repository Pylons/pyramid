Releasing Pyramid
=================

- Do any necessary branch merges (e.g. master to branch, branch to master).

- On release branch:

  $ git pull

- Do platform test via tox:

  $ tox -r

  Make sure statement coverage is at 100% (the test run will fail if not).

- Run tests on Windows if feasible.

- Make sure all scaffold tests pass (Py 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, pypy, and
  pypy3 on UNIX; this doesn't work on Windows):

  $ ./scaffoldtests.sh

- Ensure all features of the release are documented (audit CHANGES.txt or
  communicate with contributors).

- Copy relevant changes (delta bug fixes) from CHANGES.txt to
  docs/whatsnew-X.X (if it's a major release).  Minor releases should
  include a link under "Bug Fix Releases" to the minor feature
  changes in CHANGES.txt .

- update README.rst to use correct versions of badges and URLs according to
  each branch and context, i.e., RTD "latest" == GitHub/Travis "1.x-branch".

- Update whatsnew-X.X.rst in docs to point at change log entries for individual
  releases if applicable.

- Change setup.py version to the new version number.

- Change CHANGES.txt heading to reflect the new version number.

- (Optional) Update the Pyramid Dash docset.
  https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/tree/master/docsets/Pyramid

- Make sure PyPI long description renders (requires ``collective.dist``
  installed into your Python)::

  $ python setup.py check -r

- Create a release tag.

- Make sure your Python has ``setuptools-git``, ``twine`` and ``wheel``
  installed and release to PyPI::

  $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  $ twine upload dist/pyramid-X.X-*

- Edit Pylons/pylonshq/templates/home/home.mako for minor and major updates.

- Edit Pylons/pylonshq/templates/home/inside.rst for major updates only.

- Edit Pylons/pylonsrtd/pylonsrtd/docs/pyramid.rst for all updates.

- Edit `http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks
  <http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>`_.

- Publish new version of docs.

- Announce to maillist.

- Announce to Twitter.
