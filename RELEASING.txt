Releasing Pyramid
=================

- For clarity, we define releases as follows.

  - Alpha, beta, dev and similar statuses do not qualify whether a release is
    major or minor. The term "pre-release" means alpha, beta, or dev.

  - A release is final when it is no longer pre-release.

  - A *major* release is where the first number either before or after the
    first dot increases. Examples: 1.6 to 1.7a1, or 1.8 to 2.0.

  - A *minor* or *bug fix* release is where the number after the second dot
    increases. Example: 1.6 to 1.6.1.

Prepare new release branch
--------------------------

- Create a new release branch, incrementing the version number.

- Do any necessary branch merges (e.g., main to branch, branch to main).

- On release branch:

  $ git pull

- Do platform test via tox:

  $ tox -r

  Make sure statement coverage is at 100% (the test run will fail if not).

- Run tests on Windows if feasible.

- For each ``pyramid-cookiecutter-*``, make a new branch off "main" with the
  same name to align with the new Pyramid release branch name.

- In the docs, update the ``cookiecutter`` command with the new branch name,
  for example, ``cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter --checkout
  x.y-branch``. A search for ``cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-``
  should return all instances to be updated.

- Ensure all features of the release are documented (audit CHANGES.rst or
  communicate with contributors).

- Change CHANGES.rst heading to reflect the new version number.

- Copy relevant changes (delta bug fixes) from CHANGES.rst to
  docs/whatsnew-X.X (if it's a major release).  Minor releases should
  include a link under "Bug Fix Releases" to the minor feature
  changes in CHANGES.rst.

- Update README.rst to use correct versions of badges, URLs, and ALT option
  according to the new release branch name.

- Update whatsnew-X.X.rst in docs to point at change log entries for individual
  releases if applicable.

- For major version releases, in contributing.md, update branch descriptions.

- For major version releases, in docs/conf.py, update values under
  html_theme_options for in_progress and outdated across main, releasing
  branch, and previously released branch. Also in the previously released
  branch only, uncomment the sections to enable pylons_sphinx_latesturl.

- Change setup.py version to the release version number.

- Make sure PyPI long description renders::

  $ tox -e lint

- Create a release tag.

  $ git tag X.X

- Build the sdist and wheel.

  $ tox -e build

- Upload the artifacts to PyPI:

  $ twine upload dist/pyramid-X.X-*

- Configure RTD to publish the new release version of the docs.

Prepare "main" for further development (major releases only)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Checkout "main".

- In CHANGES.rst, preserve headings but clear out content. Add heading
  "unreleased" for the version number.

- From the release branch, forward port the changes in CHANGES.rst to
  HISTORY.rst.

- In contributing.md, forward port branch descriptions from release branch.

- In docs/conf.py, add a commented line under
  pylons_sphinx_latesturl_pagename_overrides for the release.

- Change setup.py version to the next version number.

- Update README.rst to use correct versions of badges, URLs, and ALT option
  for "main" instead of the major release version.

- In the docs, update the ``cookiecutter`` command with ``main``,
  for example, ``cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter --checkout
  main``. A search for ``cookiecutter gh:Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-``
  should return all instances to be updated.

Update previous version (final releases only)
---------------------------------------------

- In docs/conf.py, update values under html_theme_options for in_progress and
  outdated. Uncomment the sections to enable pylons_sphinx_latesturl.

- Configure RTD to point the "latest" alias to the new release version of the
  docs.

Cookiecutters
-------------

- For each cookiecutter, clone the newly released branch to "latest" branch.

Marketing and communications
----------------------------

- Edit Pylons/trypyramid.com/layouts/page/documentation.html for major
  releases, pre-releases, and once pre-releases are final.

- Edit `https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks
  <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>`_.

- Edit `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylons_project <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylons_project>`_.
