unreleased
==========

Features
--------

- Allow the ``append_slash`` argument of ``config.add_notfound_view`` to be
  the special value ``pyramid.view.UseSubrequest``, which will cause
  Pyramid to do a subrequest rather than a redirect when a slash-appended
  route is found associated with a view, rather than a redirect.

- Add a ``_depth`` and ``_category`` arguments to all of the venusian
  decorators. The ``_category`` argument can be used to affect which actions
  are registered when performing a ``config.scan(..., category=...)`` with a
  specific category. The ``_depth`` argument should be used when wrapping
  the decorator in your own. This change affects ``pyramid.view.view_config``,
  ``pyramid.view.exception_view_config``,
  ``pyramid.view.forbidden_view_config``, ``pyramid.view.notfound_view_config``,
  ``pyramid.events.subscriber`` and ``pyramid.response.response_adapter``
  decorators. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3105 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3122

- Fix the ``pyramid.request.Request`` class name after using
  ``set_property`` or ``config.add_request_method`` such that the
  ``str(request.__class__)`` would appear as ``pyramid.request.Request``
  instead of ``pyramid.util.Request``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3129

- In ``cherrypy_server_runner``, prefer imports from the ``cheroot`` package
  over the legacy imports from `cherrypy.wsgiserver`.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3235

- Add a context manager ``route_prefix_context`` to the
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator`` to allow for convenient setting of the
  route_prefix for ``include`` and ``add_route`` calls inside the context.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3279

- Modify the builtin session implementations to support SameSite options on
  cookies and set the default to ``'Lax'``. This affects
  ``pyramid.session.BaseCookieSessionFactory``,
  ``pyramid.session.SignedCookieSessionFactory``, and
  ``pyramid.session.UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3300

- Added new ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPPermanentRedirect``
  exception/response object for a HTTP 308 redirect.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3302

Bug Fixes
---------

- Set appropriate ``code`` and ``title`` attributes on the ``HTTPClientError``
  and ``HTTPServerError`` exception classes. This prevents inadvertently
  returning a 520 error code.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3280

- Replace ``webob.acceptparse.MIMEAccept`` from WebOb with
  ``webob.acceptparse.create_accept_header`` in the HTTP exception handling
  code. The old ``MIMEAccept`` has been deprecated. The new methods follow the
  RFC's more closely. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3251

Deprecations
------------

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- On Python 3.4+ the ``repoze.lru`` dependency is dropped. If you were using
  this package directly in your apps you should make sure that you are
  depending on it directly within your project.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3140

- Remove the ``permission`` argument from
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route``. This was an argument left over
  from a feature removed in Pyramid 1.5 and has had no effect since then.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3299

- Modify the builtin session implementations to set ``SameSite='Lax'`` on
  cookies. This affects ``pyramid.session.BaseCookieSessionFactory``,
  ``pyramid.session.SignedCookieSessionFactory``, and
  ``pyramid.session.UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3300

Documentation Changes
---------------------

- Bump Sphinx to >= 1.7.4 in setup.py to support ``emphasize-lines`` in PDFs
  and to pave the way for xelatex support.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3271,
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/667, and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2572
