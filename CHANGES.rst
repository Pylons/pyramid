unreleased
==========

Features
--------

- Changed the default ``serializer`` on
  ``pyramid.session.SignedCookieSessionFactory`` to use
  ``pyramid.session.JSONSerializer`` instead of
  ``pyramid.session.PickleSerializer``. Read
  "Changes to ISession in Pyramid 2.0" in the "Sessions" chapter of the
  documentation for more information about why this change was made.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3413

- It is now possible to control whether a route pattern contains a trailing
  slash when it is composed with a route prefix using
  ``config.include(..., route_prefix=...)`` or
  ``with config.route_prefix_context(...)``. This can be done by specifying
  an empty pattern and setting the new argument
  ``inherit_slash=True``. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      with config.route_prefix_context('/users'):
          config.add_route('users', '', inherit_slash=True)

  In the example, the resulting pattern will be ``/users``. Similarly, if the
  route prefix were ``/users/`` then the final pattern would be ``/users/``.
  If the ``pattern`` was ``'/'``, then the final pattern would always be
  ``/users/``. This new setting is only available if the pattern supplied
  to ``add_route`` is the empty string (``''``).
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3420

- No longer define ``pyramid.request.Request.json_body`` which is already
  provided by WebOb. This allows the attribute to now be settable.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3447

Deprecations
------------

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- ``pcreate`` and the builtin scaffolds have been removed in favor of
  using the ``cookiecutter`` tool and the ``pyramid-cookiecutter-starter``
  cookiecutter. The script and scaffolds were deprecated in Pyramid 1.8.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3406

- Removed ``pyramid.interfaces.ITemplateRenderer``. This interface was
  deprecated since Pyramid 1.5 and was an interface
  used by libraries like ``pyramid_mako`` and ``pyramid_chameleon`` but
  provided no functionality within Pyramid itself.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3409

- Removed ``pyramid.security.has_permission``,
  ``pyramid.security.authenticated_userid``,
  ``pyramid.security.unauthenticated_userid``, and
  ``pyramid.security.effective_principals``. These methods were deprecated
  in Pyramid 1.5 and all have equivalents available as properties on the
  request. For example, ``request.authenticated_userid``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3410

- Removed support for supplying a media range to the ``accept`` predicate of
  both ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view`` and
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route``. These options were deprecated
  in Pyramid 1.10 and WebOb 1.8 because they resulted in uncontrollable
  matching that was not compliant with the RFC.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3411

- Removed ``pyramid.session.UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig``. This
  session factory was replaced with
  ``pyramid.session.SignedCookieSessionFactory`` in Pyramid 1.5 and has been
  deprecated since then.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3412

- Removed ``pyramid.session.signed_serialize``, and
  ``pyramid.session.signed_deserialize``. These methods were only used by
  the now-removed ``pyramid.session.UnencryptedCookieSessionFactoryConfig``
  and were coupled to the vulnerable pickle serialization format which could
  lead to remove code execution if the secret key is compromised.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/3412

- Changed the default ``serializer`` on
  ``pyramid.session.SignedCookieSessionFactory`` to use
  ``pyramid.session.JSONSerializer`` instead of
  ``pyramid.session.PickleSerializer``. Read
  "Changes to ISession in Pyramid 2.0" in the "Sessions" chapter of the
  documentation for more information about why this change was made.
