Pyramid TODOs
=============

Must-Have (before 1.0)
----------------------

- Add a ``handler`` ZCML directive.  This implies some slightly dicey
  refactoring of the configurator to allow it to generate ZCML
  "discriminators" for views and routes.

- Provide a .flash API on session object.

- Make default renderer work (renderer registered with no name, which is
  active for every view unless the view names a specific renderer).

- Use ``@register_view`` instead of ``@view_config`` and change view docs to
  use "view registration" instead of "view configuration".

- SQLAlchemy idiomatics:

   <RaFromBRC> mcdonc: those paster templates all look pretty good... the
   only thing i'd consider is adjusting your config variable names to match
   exactly what sqlalchemy uses as parameter names, see here:
   http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/core/engines.html

   <RaFromBRC> mcdonc: especially in the pylons_sqla ini file, where the db
   initialization is mixed in w/ the app config...

   <RaFromBRC> ... i'd use "sqlalchemy.PARAMETER" for all of the sqla
   settings, so it could easily be handed to engine_from_config w/o any need
   to parse by hand

   <RaFromBRC> mcdonc: in the other ini files, where sqlalchemy is given its
   own part, the "sqlalchemy." prefix probably isn't necessary, but matching
   the parameter names (e.g. 'url' instead of 'db_string') is still probably
   a good idea

- Better ``config.add_handler`` documentation.

Should-Have
-----------

- Try to make test suite pass on IronPython.

- Add docs for httpexceptions module for each webob.exc class that inherits
  from WSGIHTTPException.

- Create a ``docs`` directory for each paster template.

- Remove "BFG" from Pyramid-specific environ variables.

- translationdir ZCML directive use of ``path_spec`` should maybe die.

- Add CRSF token creation/checking machinery (only "should have" vs. "must
  have" because I'm not sure it belongs in Pyramid.. it definitely must exist
  in formgen libraries, and *might* belong in Pyramid).

- Change "Cleaning up After a Request" in the urldispatch chapter to
  use ``request.add_response_callback``.

Nice-to-Have
------------

- Non-bwcompat use of threadlocals that need to be documented or ameliorated:

  security.principals_allowed_by_permission

  resource.OverrideProvider._get_overrides: can't credibly be removed,
  because it stores an overrideprovider as a module-scope global.

  traversal.traverse: this API is a stepchild, and needs to be changed.

  Configurator.add_translation_dirs: not passed any context but a message,
  can't credibly be removed.

- Supply ``X-Vhm-Host`` support.

- Basic WSGI documentation (pipeline / app / server).

- Fix message catalog extraction / compilation documentation.

- Change docs about creating a venusian decorator to not use ZCA.

- ``decorator=`` parameter to bfg_view.

- Try to better explain the relationship between a renderer and a
  template in the templates chapter and elsewhere.  Scan the
  documentation for reference to a renderer as *only* view
  configuration (it's a larger concept now).

- Create a ``render_view`` that works by using config.derive_view
  against an existing view instead of querying the registry.

- Create a function which performs a recursive request.

- Debug option to print route matching decision.

- Debug option to print view matching decision.

- Script or paster command that prints, for a given URL, the views
  that might match.  Underneath each potentially matching route, list
  the predicates required.  Underneath each route+predicate set, print
  each view that might match and its predicates.  E.g. with the input
  URL ``/foo``::

    '/foo' (foo_xhr)
       xhr = True
         (no view predicates)
           mypackage.views.MyXHRFooView.__call__

    '/{action}' (action_route)
       request_method = 'POST'
         action = '^foo$'
           mypackage.views.MyView.foo_POST
       request_method = 'GET'
         action = '^foo$'
           mypackage.views.MyView.foo_GET

- Provide a response_cookies attribute on the request for rendered
  responses that can be used as input to response.set_cookie.

- Raise an exception when a value in response_headerlist is not a
  string or decide to encode.

- Update App engine chapter with less creaky directions.

- Add functionality that mocks the behavior of ``repoze.browserid``.
