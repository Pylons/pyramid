Pyramid TODOs
=============

Nice-to-Have
------------

- Add docs about upgrading between Pyramid versions (e.g. how to see
  deprecation warnings).

- Fix renderers chapter to better document system values passed to template
  renderers.

- Modify view mapper narrative docs to not use pyramid_handlers.

- Modify the urldispatch chapter examples to assume a scan rather than
  ``add_view``.

- Decorator for append_slash_notfound_view_factory.

- Introspection:

  * ``default root factory`` category (prevent folks from needing to searh
    "root factories" category)?

  * ``default view mapper`` category (prevent folks from needing to search
    "view mappers" category)?

  * get rid of "tweens" category (can't sort properly?)

  * Introspection hiding for directives for purposes of omitting toolbar
    registrations.  Maybe toolbar can just use a null introspector?

- Fix deployment recipes in cookbook (discourage proxying without changing
  server).

- Try "with transaction.manager" in an exception view with SQLA (preempt
  homina homina response about how to write "to the database" from within in
  an exception view).  Note: tried this and couldn't formulate the right
  situation where the database could not be written to within an exception
  view (but didn't try exhaustively).

- Add narrative docs for wsgiapp and wsgiapp2.

- Flesh out "Paste" narrative docs chapter.

- Basic WSGI documentation (pipeline / app / server).

- Change docs about creating a venusian decorator to not use ZCA (use
  configurator methods instead).

- Try to better explain the relationship between a renderer and a template in
  the templates chapter and elsewhere.  Scan the documentation for reference
  to a renderer as *only* view configuration (it's a larger concept now).

- Add better docs about what-to-do-when-behind-a-proxy: paste.urlmap ("/foo =
  app1" and "domain app1.localhost = app1"), ProxyPreserveHost and the nginx
  equivalent, preserving HTTPS URLs.

- _fix_registry should dictify the registry being fixed.

- Make "localizer" a property of request (instead of requiring
  "get_localizer(request)"?

- Alias the stupid long default session factory name.

- Debug option to print view matching decision (e.g. debug_viewlookup or so).

- Non-bwcompat use of threadlocals that need to be documented or ameliorated:

  security.principals_allowed_by_permission

  resource.OverrideProvider._get_overrides: can't credibly be removed,
  because it stores an overrideprovider as a module-scope global.

  traversal.traverse: this API is a stepchild, and needs to be changed.

  Configurator.add_translation_dirs: not passed any context but a message,
  can't credibly be removed.

- Deprecate pyramid.security.view_execution_permitted (it only works for
  traversal).

- Create a function which performs a recursive request.

- Create a ``render_view`` that works by using config.derive_view against an
  existing view callable instead of querying the registry (some sort of API
  for rendering a view callable object to a response from within another view
  callable). Possible idea: have config.add_view mark up the
  function/method/class like @view_config does, then use the attached info to
  derive a view callable whenever called via some API.

- Provide a ``has_view`` function.

- Update App engine chapter with less creaky directions.

Future
------

- 1.4: Kill off ``bfg.routes`` envvars in router.

- 1.4: Remove ``chameleon_text`` / ``chameleon_zpt`` deprecated functions
  (render_*)

- 1.4: Remove ``pyramid.configuration.ConfigurationError`` (deprecated).

- 1.4: Remove ``pyramid.paster.PyramidTemplate`` (deprecated).

- 1.4: Remove ``pyramid.settings.get_settings`` (deprecated).

- 1.5: Remove all deprecated ``pyramid.testing`` functions.

- 1.5: turn ``pyramid.settings.Settings`` into a function that returns the
  original dict (after ``__getattr__`` deprecation period, it was deprecated
  in 1.2).

- 1.5: Remove ``pyramid.requests.DeprecatedRequestMethodsMixin``.

- 1.6: Remove IContextURL and TraversalContextURL.

Probably Bad Ideas
------------------

- Add functionality that mocks the behavior of ``repoze.browserid``.

- Consider implementing the API outlined in
  http://plope.com/pyramid_auth_design_api_postmortem, phasing out the
  current auth-n-auth abstractions in a backwards compatible way.

- Maybe add ``add_renderer_globals`` method to Configurator.

- Supply ``X-Vhm-Host`` support (probably better to do what paste#prefix
  middleware does).

- Have ``remember`` and ``forget`` actually set headers on the response using
  a response callback (and return the empty list)?
