Pyramid Configuration Introspection
===================================

.. versionadded:: 1.3

When Pyramid starts up, each call to a :term:`configuration directive` causes
one or more :term:`introspectable` objects to be registered with an
:term:`introspector`.  The introspector can be queried by application code to
obtain information about the configuration of the running application.  This
feature is useful for debug toolbars, command-line scripts which show some
aspect of configuration, and for runtime reporting of startup-time
configuration settings.

Using the Introspector
----------------------

Here's an example of using Pyramid's introspector from within a view
callable:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pyramid.view import view_config
    from pyramid.response import Response

    @view_config(route_name='bar')
    def show_current_route_pattern(request):
        introspector = request.registry.introspector
        route_name = request.matched_route.name
        route_intr = introspector.get('routes', route_name)
        return Response(str(route_intr['pattern']))

This view will return a response that contains the "pattern" argument
provided to the ``add_route`` method of the route which matched when the view
was called.  It uses the :meth:`pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.get` method
to return an introspectable in the category ``routes`` with a
:term:`discriminator` equal to the matched route name.  It then uses the
returned introspectable to obtain a "pattern" value.

The introspectable returned by the query methods of the introspector has
methods and attributes described by
:class:`pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospectable`.  In particular, the
:meth:`~pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.get`,
:meth:`~pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.get_category`,
:meth:`~pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.categories`,
:meth:`~pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.categorized`, and
:meth:`~pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospector.related` methods of an introspector
can be used to query for introspectables.

Introspectable Objects
----------------------

Introspectable objects are returned from query methods of an introspector.
Each introspectable object implements the attributes and methods
documented at :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IIntrospectable`.

The important attributes shared by all introspectables are the following:

``title``

  A human-readable text title describing the introspectable

``category_name``

  A text category name describing the introspection category to which this
  introspectable belongs.  It is often a plural if there are expected to be
  more than one introspectable registered within the category.

``discriminator``

  A hashable object representing the unique value of this introspectable
  within its category.

``discriminator_hash``

  The integer hash of the discriminator (useful for using in HTML links).

``type_name``

  The text name of a subtype within this introspectable's category.  If there
  is only one type name in this introspectable's category, this value will
  often be a singular version of the category name but it can be an arbitrary
  value.

``action_info``

  An object describing the directive call site which caused this
  introspectable to be registered; contains attributes described in
  :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IActionInfo`.

Besides having the attributes described above, an introspectable is a
dictionary-like object.  An introspectable can be queried for data values via
its ``__getitem__``, ``get``, ``keys``, ``values``, or ``items`` methods.
For example:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    route_intr = introspector.get('routes', 'edit_user')
    pattern = route_intr['pattern']

Pyramid Introspection Categories
--------------------------------

The list of concrete introspection categories provided by built-in Pyramid
configuration directives follows.  Add-on packages may supply other
introspectables in categories not described here.

  :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_subscriber` (or the decorator
  equivalent); each will have the following data.

    call it with more than one argument if your original subscriber accepts
    only one.

    to ``add_susbcriber``

  ``derived_predicates``

Introspection in the Toolbar
----------------------------

The Pyramid debug toolbar (part of the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` package)
provides a canned view of all registered introspectables and their
relationships.  It looks something like this:

.. image:: tb_introspector.png

Disabling Introspection
-----------------------

You can disable Pyramid introspection by passing the flag
``introspection=False`` to the :term:`Configurator` constructor in your
application setup:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyramid.config import Configurator
   config = Configurator(..., introspection=False)

When ``introspection`` is ``False``, all introspectables generated by
configuration directives are thrown away.
