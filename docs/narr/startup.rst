Startup
=======

When you cause a :app:`Pyramid` application to start up in a console window,
you'll see something much like this show up on the console:

.. code-block:: text

  $ pserve development.ini
  Starting server in PID 16601.
  serving on 0.0.0.0:6543 view at http://127.0.0.1:6543

This chapter explains what happens between the time you press the "Return"
key on your keyboard after typing ``pserve development.ini``
and the time the line ``serving on 0.0.0.0:6543 ...`` is output to your
console.

The Startup Process
-------------------

The easiest and best-documented way to start and serve a :app:`Pyramid`
application is to use the ``pserve`` command against a :term:`PasteDeploy`
``.ini`` file.  This uses the ``.ini`` file to infer settings and starts a
server listening on a port.  For the purposes of this discussion, we'll
assume that you are using this command to run your :app:`Pyramid`
application.

Here's a high-level time-ordered overview of what happens when you press
``return`` after running ``pserve development.ini``.

#. The ``pserve`` command is invoked under your shell with the argument
   ``development.ini``.  As a result, Pyramid recognizes that it is meant to
   begin to run and serve an application using the information contained
   within the ``development.ini`` file.

#. The framework finds a section named either ``[app:main]``,
   ``[pipeline:main]``, or ``[composite:main]`` in the ``.ini`` file.  This
   section represents the configuration of a :term:`WSGI` application that
   will be served.  If you're using a simple application (e.g.
   ``[app:main]``), the application's ``paste.app_factory`` :term:`entry
   point` will be named on the ``use=`` line within the section's
   configuration.  If, instead of a simple application, you're using a WSGI
   :term:`pipeline` (e.g. a ``[pipeline:main]`` section), the application
   named on the "last" element will refer to your :app:`Pyramid` application.
   If instead of a simple application or a pipeline, you're using a
   "composite" (e.g. ``[composite:main]``), refer to the documentation for
   that particular composite to understand how to make it refer to your
   :app:`Pyramid` application.  In most cases, a Pyramid application built
   from a scaffold will have a single ``[app:main]`` section in it, and this
   will be the application served.

#. The framework finds all :mod:`logging` related configuration in the
   ``.ini`` file and uses it to configure the Python standard library logging
   system for this application.  See :ref:`logging_config` for more
   information.

#. The application's *constructor* named by the entry point reference on the
   ``use=`` line of the section representing your :app:`Pyramid` application
   is passed the key/value parameters mentioned within the section in which
   it's defined.  The constructor is meant to return a :term:`router`
   instance, which is a :term:`WSGI` application.

   For :app:`Pyramid` applications, the constructor will be a function named
   ``main`` in the ``__init__.py`` file within the :term:`package` in which
   your application lives.  If this function succeeds, it will return a
   :app:`Pyramid` :term:`router` instance.  Here's the contents of an example
   ``__init__.py`` module:

   .. literalinclude:: MyProject/myproject/__init__.py
      :language: python
      :linenos:

   Note that the constructor function accepts a ``global_config`` argument,
   which is a dictionary of key/value pairs mentioned in the ``[DEFAULT]``
   section of an ``.ini`` file
   (if :ref:`[DEFAULT] <defaults_section_of_pastedeploy_file>` is present).
   It also accepts a ``**settings`` argument, which collects
   another set of arbitrary key/value pairs.  The arbitrary key/value pairs
   received by this function in ``**settings`` will be composed of all the
   key/value pairs that are present in the ``[app:main]`` section (except for
   the ``use=`` setting) when this function is called by when you run
   ``pserve``.

   Our generated ``development.ini`` file looks like so:

   .. literalinclude:: MyProject/development.ini
      :language: ini
      :linenos:

   In this case, the ``myproject.__init__:main`` function referred to by the
   entry point URI ``egg:MyProject`` (see :ref:`MyProject_ini` for more
   information about entry point URIs, and how they relate to callables),
   will receive the key/value pairs ``{'pyramid.reload_templates':'true',
   'pyramid.debug_authorization':'false', 'pyramid.debug_notfound':'false',
   'pyramid.debug_routematch':'false', 'pyramid.debug_templates':'true',
   'pyramid.default_locale_name':'en'}``.  See :ref:`environment_chapter` for
   the meanings of these keys.

#. The ``main`` function first constructs a
   :class:`~pyramid.config.Configurator` instance, passing the ``settings``
   dictionary captured via the ``**settings`` kwarg as its ``settings``
   argument.

   The ``settings`` dictionary contains all the options in the ``[app:main]``
   section of our .ini file except the ``use`` option (which is internal to
   PasteDeploy) such as ``pyramid.reload_templates``,
   ``pyramid.debug_authorization``, etc.

#. The ``main`` function then calls various methods on the instance of the
   class :class:`~pyramid.config.Configurator` created in the previous step.
   The intent of calling these methods is to populate an
   :term:`application registry`, which represents the :app:`Pyramid`
   configuration related to the application.

#. The :meth:`~pyramid.config.Configurator.make_wsgi_app` method is called.
   The result is a :term:`router` instance.  The router is associated with
   the :term:`application registry` implied by the configurator previously
   populated by other methods run against the Configurator.  The router is a
   WSGI application.

#. A :class:`~pyramid.events.ApplicationCreated` event is emitted (see
   :ref:`events_chapter` for more information about events).

#. Assuming there were no errors, the ``main`` function in ``myproject``
   returns the router instance created by
   :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.make_wsgi_app` back to ``pserve``.  As
   far as ``pserve`` is concerned, it is "just another WSGI application".

#. ``pserve`` starts the WSGI *server* defined within the ``[server:main]``
   section.  In our case, this is the Waitress server (``use =
   egg:waitress#main``), and it will listen on all interfaces (``host =
   0.0.0.0``), on port number 6543 (``port = 6543``).  The server code itself
   is what prints ``serving on 0.0.0.0:6543 view at http://127.0.0.1:6543``.
   The server serves the application, and the application is running, waiting
   to receive requests.

Deployment Settings
-------------------

Note that an augmented version of the values passed as ``**settings`` to the
:class:`~pyramid.config.Configurator` constructor will be available in
:app:`Pyramid` :term:`view callable` code as ``request.registry.settings``.
You can create objects you wish to access later from view code, and put them
into the dictionary you pass to the configurator as ``settings``.  They will
then be present in the ``request.registry.settings`` dictionary at
application runtime.
