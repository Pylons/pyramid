Request and Response Objects
============================

.. note:: This chapter is adapted from a portion of the :term:`WebOb`
   documentation, originally written by Ian Bicking.

:app:`Pyramid` uses the :term:`WebOb` package as a basis for its
:term:`request` and :term:`response` object implementations.  The
:term:`request` object that is passed to a :app:`Pyramid` :term:`view` is an
instance of the :class:`pyramid.request.Request` class, which is a subclass
of :class:`webob.Request`.  The :term:`response` returned from a
:app:`Pyramid` :term:`view` :term:`renderer` is an instance of the
:mod:`pyramid.response.Response` class, which is a subclass of the
:class:`webob.Response` class.  Users can also return an instance of
:class:`pyramid.response.Response` directly from a view as necessary.

WebOb is a project separate from :app:`Pyramid` with a separate set of
authors and a fully separate `set of documentation
<http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.  Pyramid adds some
functionality to the standard WebOb request, which is documented in the
:ref:`request_module` API documentation.

WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.  Specifically it does
this by wrapping the `WSGI <http://wsgi.org>`_ request environment and
response status, header list, and app_iter (body) values.

WebOb request and response objects provide many conveniences for parsing WSGI
requests and forming WSGI responses.  WebOb is a nice way to represent "raw"
WSGI requests and responses; however, we won't cover that use case in this
document, as users of :app:`Pyramid` don't typically need to use the
WSGI-related features of WebOb directly.  The `reference documentation
<http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/reference.html>`_ shows many examples of
creating requests and using response objects in this manner, however.

   single: request attributes

Request
~~~~~~~

The request object is a wrapper around the `WSGI environ dictionary
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#environ-variables>`_.  This
dictionary contains keys for each header, keys that describe the
request (including the path and query string), a file-like object for
the request body, and a variety of custom keys.  You can always access
the environ with ``req.environ``.

Some of the most important/interesting attributes of a request
object:

``req.method``:
    The request method, e.g., ``'GET'``, ``'POST'``

``req.GET``:
    A :term:`multidict` with all the variables in the query
    string.

``req.POST``:
    A :term:`multidict` with all the variables in the request
    body.  This only has variables if the request was a ``POST`` and
    it is a form submission.  

``req.params``:
    A :term:`multidict` with a combination of everything in
    ``req.GET`` and ``req.POST``.

``req.body``:
    The contents of the body of the request.  This contains the entire
    request body as a string.  This is useful when the request is a
    ``POST`` that is *not* a form submission, or a request like a
    ``PUT``.  You can also get ``req.body_file`` for a file-like
    object.

``req.json_body``
    The JSON-decoded contents of the body of the request. See
    :ref:`request_json_body`.

``req.cookies``:
    A simple dictionary of all the cookies.

``req.headers``:
    A dictionary of all the headers.  This dictionary is case-insensitive.

``req.urlvars`` and ``req.urlargs``:
    ``req.urlvars`` are the keyword parameters associated with the
    request URL.  ``req.urlargs`` are the positional parameters.
    These are set by products like `Routes
    <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_ and `Selector
    <http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/>`_.

Also, for standard HTTP request headers there are usually attributes,
for instance: ``req.accept_language``, ``req.content_length``,
``req.user_agent``, as an example.  These properties expose the
*parsed* form of each header, for whatever parsing makes sense.  For
instance, ``req.if_modified_since`` returns a `datetime
<http://python.org/doc/current/lib/datetime-datetime.html>`_ object
(or None if the header is was not provided).

.. note:: Full API documentation for the :app:`Pyramid` request
   object is available in :ref:`request_module`.

   single: request attributes (special)

.. _special_request_attributes:

Special Attributes Added to the Request by :app:`Pyramid`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to the standard :term:`WebOb` attributes, :app:`Pyramid` adds
special attributes to every request: ``context``, ``registry``, ``root``,
``subpath``, ``traversed``, ``view_name``, ``virtual_root``,
``virtual_root_path``, ``session``, ``matchdict``, and ``matched_route``.
These attributes are documented further within the
:class:`pyramid.request.Request` API documentation.

.. index::
   single: request URLs

URLs
++++

In addition to these attributes, there are several ways to get the URL
of the request.  I'll show various values for an example URL
``http://localhost/app/blog?id=10``, where the application is mounted at
``http://localhost/app``.

``req.url``:
    The full request URL, with query string, e.g.,
    ``http://localhost/app/blog?id=10``

``req.host``:
    The host information in the URL, e.g.,
    ``localhost``

``req.host_url``:
    The URL with the host, e.g., ``http://localhost``

``req.application_url``:
    The URL of the application (just the SCRIPT_NAME portion of the
    path, not PATH_INFO).  E.g., ``http://localhost/app``

``req.path_url``:
    The URL of the application including the PATH_INFO. e.g.,
    ``http://localhost/app/blog``

``req.path``:
    The URL including PATH_INFO without the host or scheme. e.g.,
    ``/app/blog``

``req.path_qs``:
    The URL including PATH_INFO and the query string. e.g,
    ``/app/blog?id=10``

``req.query_string``:
    The query string in the URL, e.g.,
    ``id=10``

``req.relative_url(url, to_application=False)``:
    Gives a URL, relative to the current URL.  If ``to_application``
    is True, then resolves it relative to ``req.application_url``.

.. index::
   single: request methods

Methods
+++++++

There are methods of request objects documented in
:class:`pyramid.request.Request` but you'll find that you won't use very many
of them.  Here are a couple that might be useful:

``Request.blank(base_url)``:
    Creates a new request with blank information, based at the given
    URL.  This can be useful for subrequests and artificial requests.
    You can also use ``req.copy()`` to copy an existing request, or
    for subrequests ``req.copy_get()`` which copies the request but
    always turns it into a GET (which is safer to share for
    subrequests).

``req.get_response(wsgi_application)``:
    This method calls the given WSGI application with this request, and
    returns a :class:`pyramid.response.Response` object.  You can also use
    this for subrequests, or testing.

.. index::
   single: request (and unicode)
   single: unicode (and the request)

Unicode
+++++++

Many of the properties in the request object will return unicode
values if the request encoding/charset is provided.  The client *can*
indicate the charset with something like ``Content-Type:
application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf8``, but browsers seldom
set this.  You can set the charset with ``req.charset = 'utf8'``, or
during instantiation with ``Request(environ, charset='utf8')``.  If
you subclass ``Request`` you can also set ``charset`` as a class-level
attribute.

If it is set, then ``req.POST``, ``req.GET``, ``req.params``, and
``req.cookies`` will contain unicode strings.  Each has a
corresponding ``req.str_*`` (e.g., ``req.str_POST``) that is always
a ``str``, and never unicode.

.. index::
   single: multidict (WebOb)

.. _multidict_narr:

Multidict
+++++++++

Several attributes of a WebOb request are "multidict"; structures (such as
``request.GET``, ``request.POST``, and ``request.params``).  A multidict is a
dictionary where a key can have multiple values.  The quintessential example
is a query string like ``?pref=red&pref=blue``; the ``pref`` variable has two
values: ``red`` and ``blue``.

In a multidict, when you do ``request.GET['pref']`` you'll get back
only ``'blue'`` (the last value of ``pref``).  Sometimes returning a
string, and sometimes returning a list, is the cause of frequent
exceptions.  If you want *all* the values back, use
``request.GET.getall('pref')``.  If you want to be sure there is *one
and only one* value, use ``request.GET.getone('pref')``, which will
raise an exception if there is zero or more than one value for
``pref``.

When you use operations like ``request.GET.items()`` you'll get back
something like ``[('pref', 'red'), ('pref', 'blue')]``.  All the
key/value pairs will show up.  Similarly ``request.GET.keys()``
returns ``['pref', 'pref']``.  Multidict is a view on a list of
tuples; all the keys are ordered, and all the values are ordered.

API documentation for a multidict exists as
:class:`pyramid.interfaces.IMultiDict`.

.. index::
   pair: json_body; request

.. _request_json_body:

Dealing With A JSON-Encoded Request Body
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: 1.1

:attr:`pyramid.request.Request.json_body` is a property that returns a
:term:`JSON` -decoded representation of the request body.  If the request
does not have a body, or the body is not a properly JSON-encoded value, an
exception will be raised when this attribute is accessed.

This attribute is useful when you invoke a Pyramid view callable via
e.g. jQuery's ``$.ajax`` function, which has the potential to send a request
with a JSON-encoded body.

Using ``request.json_body`` is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

   from json import loads
   loads(request.body, encoding=request.charset)

Here's how to construct an AJAX request in Javascript using :term:`jQuery`
that allows you to use the ``request.json_body`` attribute when the request
is sent to a Pyramid application:

.. code-block:: javascript

    jQuery.ajax({type:'POST', 
                 url: 'http://localhost:6543/', // the pyramid server
                 data: JSON.stringify({'a':1}), 
                 contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8'});

When such a request reaches a view in your application, the
``request.json_body`` attribute will be available in the view callable body.

.. code-block:: javascript

    @view_config(renderer='string')
    def aview(request):
        print(request.json_body)
        return 'OK'

For the above view, printed to the console will be:

.. code-block:: python

    {u'a': 1}

For bonus points, here's a bit of client-side code that will produce a
request that has a body suitable for reading via ``request.json_body`` using
Python's ``urllib2`` instead of a Javascript AJAX request:

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib2
    import json        

    json_payload = json.dumps({'a':1})
    headers = {'Content-Type':'application/json; charset=utf-8'}
    req = urllib2.Request('http://localhost:6543/', json_payload, headers)
    resp = urllib2.urlopen(req)

.. index::
   single: cleaning up after request

.. _cleaning_up_after_a_request:

Cleaning Up After a Request
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes it's required that some cleanup be performed at the end of a
request when a database connection is involved.  

For example, let's say you have a ``mypackage`` :app:`Pyramid` application
package that uses SQLAlchemy, and you'd like the current SQLAlchemy database
session to be removed after each request.  Put the following in the
``mypackage.__init__`` module:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from mypackage.models import DBSession

   from pyramid.events import subscriber
   from pyramid.events import NewRequest

   def cleanup_callback(request):
       DBSession.remove()

   @subscriber(NewRequest)
   def add_cleanup_callback(event):
       event.request.add_finished_callback(cleanup_callback)

Registering the ``cleanup_callback`` finished callback at the start of a
request (by causing the ``add_cleanup_callback`` to receive a
:class:`pyramid.events.NewRequest` event at the start of each request) will
cause the DBSession to be removed whenever request processing has ended.
Note that in the example above, for the :class:`pyramid.events.subscriber`
decorator to "work", the :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.scan` method must
be called against your ``mypackage`` package during application
initialization.

.. note:: This is only an example.  In particular, it is not necessary to
   cause ``DBSession.remove`` to be called in an application generated from
   any :app:`Pyramid` scaffold, because these all use the ``pyramid_tm``
   package.  The cleanup done by ``DBSession.remove`` is unnecessary when
   ``pyramid_tm`` :term:`middleware` is configured into the application.

More Details
++++++++++++

More detail about the request object API is available in:

- The :class:`pyramid.request.Request` API documentation.

- The `WebOb documentation <http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
  All methods and attributes of a ``webob.Request`` documented within the
  WebOb documentation will work with request objects created by
  :app:`Pyramid`.

.. index::
   single: response object

Response
~~~~~~~~

The :app:`Pyramid` response object can be imported as
:class:`pyramid.response.Response`.  This class is a subclass of the
``webob.Response`` class.  The subclass does not add or change any
functionality, so the WebOb Response documentation will be completely
relevant for this class as well.

A response object has three fundamental parts:

``response.status``:
	The response code plus reason message, like ``'200 OK'``.  To set
	the code without a message, use ``status_int``, i.e.:
	``response.status_int = 200``.

``response.headerlist``:
    A list of all the headers, like ``[('Content-Type',
    'text/html')]``.  There's a case-insensitive :term:`multidict`
    in ``response.headers`` that also allows you to access
    these same headers.

``response.app_iter``:
    An iterable (such as a list or generator) that will produce the
    content of the response.  This is also accessible as
    ``response.body`` (a string), ``response.unicode_body`` (a
    unicode object, informed by ``response.charset``), and
    ``response.body_file`` (a file-like object; writing to it appends
    to ``app_iter``).

Everything else in the object typically derives from this underlying state.
Here are some highlights:

``response.content_type``
    The content type *not* including the ``charset`` parameter.
    Typical use: ``response.content_type = 'text/html'``.

``response.charset``:
    The ``charset`` parameter of the content-type, it also informs
    encoding in ``response.unicode_body``.
    ``response.content_type_params`` is a dictionary of all the
    parameters.

``response.set_cookie(key, value, max_age=None, path='/', ...)``: 
    Set a cookie.  The keyword arguments control the various cookie
    parameters.  The ``max_age`` argument is the length for the cookie
    to live in seconds (you may also use a timedelta object).  The
    ``Expires`` key will also be set based on the value of
    ``max_age``.

``response.delete_cookie(key, path='/', domain=None)``:
    Delete a cookie from the client.  This sets ``max_age`` to 0 and
    the cookie value to ``''``.

``response.cache_expires(seconds=0)``:
    This makes this response cacheable for the given number of seconds,
    or if ``seconds`` is 0 then the response is uncacheable (this also
    sets the ``Expires`` header).

``response(environ, start_response)``: 
    The response object is a WSGI application.  As an application, it
    acts according to how you create it.  It *can* do conditional
    responses if you pass ``conditional_response=True`` when
    instantiating (or set that attribute later).  It can also do HEAD
    and Range requests.

.. index::
   single: response headers

Headers
+++++++

Like the request, most HTTP response headers are available as
properties.  These are parsed, so you can do things like
``response.last_modified = os.path.getmtime(filename)``.

The details are available in the `extracted Response documentation
<http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/modules/webob.html#headers>`_.

.. index::
   single: response (creating)

Instantiating the Response
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Of course most of the time you just want to *make* a response.  
Generally any attribute of the response can be passed in as a keyword
argument to the class; e.g.:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  from pyramid.response import Response
  response = Response(body='hello world!', content_type='text/plain')

The status defaults to ``'200 OK'``.  The content_type does not default to
anything, though if you subclass :class:`pyramid.response.Response` and set
``default_content_type`` you can override this behavior.

.. index::
   single: exception responses

Exception Responses
+++++++++++++++++++

To facilitate error responses like ``404 Not Found``, the module
:mod:`pyramid.httpexceptions` contains classes for each kind of error
response.  These include boring, but appropriate error bodies.  The
exceptions exposed by this module, when used under :app:`Pyramid`, should be
imported from the :mod:`pyramid.httpexceptions` module.  This import location
contains subclasses and replacements that mirror those in the ``webob.exc``
module.

Each class is named ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTP*``, where ``*`` is the
reason for the error.  For instance,
:class:`pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPNotFound` subclasses
:class:`pyramid.response.Response`, so you can manipulate the instances in the same
way.  A typical example is:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPNotFound
    from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPMovedPermanently

    response = HTTPNotFound('There is no such resource')
    # or:
    response = HTTPMovedPermanently(location=new_url)

More Details
++++++++++++

More details about the response object API are available in the
:mod:`pyramid.response` documentation.  More details about exception
responses are in the :mod:`pyramid.httpexceptions` API documentation.  The
`WebOb documentation <http://docs.webob.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ is also
useful.
