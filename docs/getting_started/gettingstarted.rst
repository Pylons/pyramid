What is Pyramid?
----------------

Pyramid is a web application development framework.  Pyramid is lean, fast, stable, well-tested, and thoroughly documented.  Pyramid is written in Python, and is open source software released under a `BSD-like license <http://repoze.org/license.html>`_.

Pyramid helps you "start small, finish big".  You can create a simple web application using Pyramid with only basic knowledge.  As you become more familiar with Pyramid, you'll find there is plenty of room to grow.  Code you started with early on can be re-used in mature, large, powerful applications.

Pyramid has dozens of features — URL generation, authentication and authorization, [one or two more?] — just like any other web application framework.  Several features are unique and make Pyramid stand out from the crowd.

* Traversal
* Python 3 compatibility
* Tweens
* Debug Toolbar

Installation Guide
------------------
The Installation Guide describes how to install everything needed to get started with Pyramid.  It also offers practical advice on working with projects.  Whether you're new to Pyramid, Python, programming, or web application development, the Installation Guide will help you get your first Pyramid application up and running and deployed into production.

Developer Guide
---------------
The Developer Guide describes Pyramid in depth.  Formerly called "narrative documentation", the Developer Guide uses technical terms more familiar to the seasoned web application developer.  Beginners may be challenged, to put it mildly, but it's a challenge worth accepting.  Developers who have already installed Pyramid, worked through a few tutorials, and are ready to write their own applications will find that this guide offers a comprehensive understanding of Pyramid.

API Guide
---------
The API Guide is a comprehensive reference for every public application programming interface (API) exposed by Pyramid.  The API Guide lists each item, its arguments, definition, narrative description, its inner workings, and the values and objects it returns in great detail.

Tutorials and Screencasts
-------------------------
There are several tutorials and screencasts that give beginners and new-comers to Pyramid hands-on experience with writing Pyramid applications.
