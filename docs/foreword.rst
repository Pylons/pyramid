.. sidebar::  A Foreword By Paul Everitt

   Paul Everitt is a principal at :term:`Agendaless Consulting`.
   Before his time at Agendaless, he was the co-founder of *Digital
   Creations*, which later became *Zope Corporation*.  He has been
   a widely respected member of the Python community since 1994.

Some times amazing things can actually happen.

In the world of web frameworks, the rate of radioactive decay is very high.
Projects are starting, splintering, folding, and clashing constantly.  For
Python, there are over 50 listed web frameworks.  In some ways this shows
health and experimentation.  Yet others have started to ask: "Is this really
good for Python developers?"

This book is the result of an event which bucked this trend, an event which
Armin Ronacher wrote was "one of the greatest moves in Python's web framework
history."  Two projects merged and are bringing in a third.  Consolidation
won a victory over splintering.

As someone from the Zope world, I had a strong interest in repoze.bfg.  I
viewed it as the escape hatch for Zope, teleporting us into the modern world
of Python development, permitting but not requiring Zope-style idioms.  Chris
McDonough established a great brand for repoze.bfg: small, documented,
tested, fast, stable, friendly.  As the project manager for a very large
repoze.bfg application, I can strongly attest that it was a home run on those
points.

But in a crowded web frameworks landscape, repoze.bfg was a long-shot to get
critical mass.  It had a lot to offer, but was missing critical pieces such
as momentum and name recognition.

Pylons has long been viewed as holding the number two spot in Python web
frameworks.  It is one of (if not the) first "modern" web framework.  With
lots of users, and a "full-stack" framework atop it (TurboGears), Pylons had
momentum and name recognition aplenty.  But it needed more resources to
accomplish its goals of an architectural transition, and Ben Bangert needed
to share the load as architect during the transition.

Ben and Chris started talking during 2011 about architectural patterns and
discovered Pylons and repoze.bfg covered almost exactly the same surface
area.  After some experiments, it became clear that, technically at least,
the next version of Pylons could be the same as the next version of
repoze.bfg.

But what about the non-technical parts?  It was one thing to consolidate
code.  Consolidating projects was new territory.

I was fortunate to meet with the principals in Las Vegas and watch as they
hashed out the idea.  The projects would merge and keep the Pylons identity.
repoze.bfg would sacrifice its identity, but provide the technical
foundation.  All the resources from the two projects would be combined.

I'll confess, I had high hopes for the outcome.  Now that the merge has
happened and 1.0 released, I can honestly say it has done better than I could
have imagined.  The story of "consolidation" is catching on, and interest in
working together is growing.  Pyramid 1.0 is very, very high quality and
ready to go for PyCon 2011.  People interested in "simple, fast, documented,
tested" have a strong framework and healthy project.

It took humility, patience, and pragmatism to reach this point of obvious
success.  Certainly by the project leaders, who each had to give up some of
their sovereignty and sacred cows.  But as well, each community had to
discuss the challenges, the various alternatives for going forward, and the
pros and cons of consolidation in general but also this particular
consolidation. That such a conversation and change could happen in a
responsible, adult fashion speaks volumes about the strength and maturity of
each community.

What might happen in 2011?  TurboGears is considering a move into the
umbrella Pylons Project.  As Armin writes in his post, there is fertile
ground for consolidation at other layers. In my own interests, I hope the
worlds of Zope and Plone view Pyramid as the base for the next decade of
their ideas.  But also, the Pylons Project as a vibrant home for such ideas.

Congratulations, Pylons Project.  Not only have you accelerated your spot on
the Python web frameworks chart, but you have injected the word
"consolidation" into the lexicon of hot ideas for 2011.
