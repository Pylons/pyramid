13: CSS/JS/Images Files With Static Assets
==========================================

Of course the Web is more than just markup. You need static assets:
CSS, JS, and images. Let's point our web app at a directory where
Pyramid will serve some static assets.

Objectives
==========

- Publish a directory of static assets at a URL

- Use Pyramid to help generate URLs to files in that directory

Steps
=====

#. First we copy the results of the ``view_classes`` step:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ..; cp -r view_classes static_assets; cd static_assets
    $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

#. We add a call ``config.add_static_view in
   ``static_assets/tutorial/__init__.py``:

   .. literalinclude:: static_assets/tutorial/__init__.py
    :linenos:

#. We can add a CSS link in the ``<head>`` of our template at
   ``static_assets/tutorial/home.pt``:

   .. literalinclude:: static_assets/tutorial/home.pt
    :language: html

#. Add a CSS file at
   ``static_assets/tutorial/static/app.css``:

   .. literalinclude:: static_assets/tutorial/static/app.css
    :language: css

#. Make sure we haven't broken any existing code by running the tests:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/nosetests tutorial

#. Run your Pyramid application with:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

#. Open http://localhost:6543/ in your browser and note the new font.

Analysis
========

We changed our WSGI application to map requests under
http://localhost:6543/static/ to files and directories inside a
``static`` directory inside our ``tutorial`` package. This directory
contained ``app.css``.

We linked to the CSS in our template. We could have hard-coded this
link to ``/static/app.css``. But what if the site is later moved under
``/somesite/static/``? Or perhaps the web developer changes the
arrangement on disk? Pyramid gives a helper that provides flexibility
on URL generation:

.. code-block:: html

  ${request.static_url('tutorial:static/app.css')}

This matches the ``path='tutorial:static'`` in our
``config.add_static_view`` registration. By using ``request.static_url``
to generate the full URL to the static assets, you both ensure you stay
in sync with the configuration and gain refactoring flexibility later.

Extra Credit
============

#. There is also a ``request.static_path`` API.  How does this differ from 
   ``request.static_url``?
