=============================================
Prelude: Quick Project Startup with Scaffolds
=============================================

To ease the process of getting started, Pyramid provides *scaffolds*
that generate sample projects from templates in Pyramid and Pyramid
add-ons.

Background
==========

We're going to cover a lot in this tutorial, focusing on one topic at a
time and writing everything from scratch. As a warmup, though,
it sure would be nice to see some pixels on a screen.

Like other web development frameworks, Pyramid provides a number of
"scaffolds" that generate working Python, template, and CSS code for
sample applications. In this step we'll use a built-in scaffold to let
us preview a Pyramid application, before starting from scratch on Step 1.

Objectives
==========

- Use Pyramid's ``pcreate`` command to list scaffolds and make a new
  project

- Start up a Pyramid application and visit it in a web browser

Steps
=====

#. Pyramid's ``pcreate`` command can list the available scaffolds:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ $VENV/bin/pcreate --list
        Available scaffolds:
          alchemy:                 Pyramid SQLAlchemy project using url dispatch
          starter:                 Pyramid starter project
          zodb:                    Pyramid ZODB project using traversal

#. Tell ``pcreate`` to use the ``starter`` scaffold to make our project:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ $VENV/bin/pcreate --scaffold starter scaffolds

#. Use normal Python development to setup our project for development:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd scaffolds
        $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

#. Startup the application by pointing Pyramid's ``pserve`` command at
   the project's (generated) configuration file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

   On startup, ``pserve`` logs some output:

   .. code-block:: bash

     Starting subprocess with file monitor
     Starting server in PID 72213.
     Starting HTTP server on http://0.0.0.0:6543

#. Open http://localhost:6543/ in your browser.

Analysis
========

Rather than starting from scratch, ``pcreate`` can make getting a
Python project containing a Pyramid application a quick matter.
Pyramid ships with a few scaffolds. But installing a Pyramid add-on can
give you new scaffolds from that add-on.

``pserve`` is Pyramid's application runner, separating operational
details from your code. When you install Pyramid, a small command
program called ``pserve`` is written to your ``bin`` directory. This
program is an executable Python module. It is passed a configuration
file (in this case, ``development.ini``.)
