03: Application Configuration with ``.ini`` Files
=================================================

Use Pyramid's ``pserve`` command with a ``.ini`` configuration file for
simpler, better application running.

Background
==========

Pyramid has a first-class concept of
:ref:`configuration <configuration_narr>` distinct from code.
This approach is optional, but its presence makes it distinct from
other Python web frameworks. It taps into Python's ``setuptools``
library, which establishes conventions for how Python projects can be
installed and provide "entry points". Pyramid uses an entry point to
let a Pyramid application it where to find the WSGI app.

Objectives
==========

- Modify our ``setup.py`` to have an entry point telling Pyramid the
  location of the WSGI app

- Create an application driven by a ``.ini`` file

- Startup the application with Pyramid's ``pserve`` command

- Move code into the package's ``__init__.py``

Steps
=====

#. First we copy the results of the previous step:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ..; cp -r package ini; cd ini

#. Our ``ini/setup.py`` needs a setuptools "entry point" in the
   ``setup()`` function:

   .. literalinclude:: ini/setup.py
    :linenos:

#. We can now install our project, thus generating (or re-generating) an
   "egg" at ``ini/tutorial.egg-info``:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

#. Let's make a file ``ini/development.ini`` for our configuration:

   .. literalinclude:: ini/development.ini
    :language: ini
    :linenos:

#. We can refactor our startup code from the previous step's ``app.py``
   into ``ini/tutorial/__init__.py``:

   .. literalinclude:: ini/tutorial/__init__.py
    :linenos:

#. Now that ``ini/tutorial/app.py`` isn't used, let's remove it:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ rm tutorial/app.py

#. Run your Pyramid application with:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

#. Open http://localhost:6543/.

Analysis
========

Our ``development.ini`` file is read by ``pserve`` and serves to
bootstrap our application. Processing then proceeds as described in
the Pyramid chapter on
:ref:`application startup <startup_chapter>`:

- ``pserve`` looks for ``[app:main]`` and finds ``use = egg:tutorial``

- The projects's ``setup.py`` has defined an "entry point" (lines 9-10)
  for the project  "main" entry point of ``tutorial:main``

- The ``tutorial`` package's ``__init__`` has a ``main`` function

- This function is invoked, with the values from certain ``.ini``
  sections passed in

The ``.ini`` file is also used for two other functions:

- *Configuring the WSGI server*. ``[server:main]`` wires up the choice of
  which WSGI *server* for your WSGI *application*. In this case, we are using
  ``wsgiref`` bundled in the Python library.  It also wires up the *port
  number*:   ``port = 6543`` tells ``wsgiref`` to listen on port 6543.

- *Configuring Python logging*. Pyramid uses Python standard logging, which
  needs a number of configuration values. The ``.ini`` serves this function.
  This provides the console log output that you see on startup and each
  request.

We moved our startup code from ``app.py`` to the package's
``tutorial/__init__.py``. This isn't necessary,
but it is a common style in Pyramid to take the WSGI app bootstrapping
out of your module's code and put it in the package's ``__init__.py``.

The ``pserve`` application runner has a number of command-line arguments
and options. We are using ``--reload`` which tells ``pserve`` to watch
the filesystem for changes to relevant code (Python files, the INI file,
etc.) and, when something changes, restart the application. Very handy
during development.

Extra Credit
============

#. If you don't like configuration and/or ``.ini`` files,
   could you do this yourself in Python code?

#. Can we have multiple ``.ini`` configuration files for a project? Why
   might you want to do that?

#. The entry point in ``setup.py`` didn't mention ``__init__.py`` when
   it declared ``tutorial:main`` function. Why not?
