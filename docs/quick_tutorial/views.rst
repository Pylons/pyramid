07: Basic Web Handling With Views
=================================

Organize a views module with decorators and multiple views.

Background
==========

For the examples so far, the ``hello_world`` function is a "view". In
Pyramid, views are the primary way to accept web requests and return
responses.

So far our examples place everything in one file:

- The view function

- Its registration with the configurator

- The route to map it to a URL

- The WSGI application launcher

Let's move the views out to their own ``views.py`` module and change
our startup code to scan that module, looking for decorators that setup
the views. Let's also add a second view and update our tests.

Objectives
==========

- Views in a module that is scanned by the configurator

- Decorators that do declarative configuration

Steps
=====

#. Let's begin by using the previous package as a starting point for a
   new distribution, then making it active:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ..; cp -r functional_testing views; cd views
    $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

#. Our ``views/tutorial/__init__.py`` gets a lot shorter:

   .. literalinclude:: views/tutorial/__init__.py
    :linenos:

#. Let's add a module ``views/tutorial/views.py`` that is focused on
   handling requests and responses:

   .. literalinclude:: views/tutorial/views.py
    :linenos:

#. Update the tests to cover the two new views:

   .. literalinclude:: views/tutorial/tests.py
    :linenos:

#. Now run the tests:

   .. code-block:: bash


    $ $VENV/bin/nosetests tutorial
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 4 tests in 0.141s

    OK

#. Run your Pyramid application with:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

#. Open http://localhost:6543/ and http://localhost:6543/howdy
   in your browser.

Analysis
========

We added some more URLs, but we also removed the view code from the
application startup code in ``tutorial/__init__.py``.
Our views, and their view registrations (via decorators) are now in a
module ``views.py`` which is scanned via ``config.scan('.views')``.

We have 2 views, each leading to the other. If you start at
http://localhost:6543/, you get a response with a link to the next
view. The ``hello_view`` (available at the URL ``/howdy``) has a link
back to the first view.

This step also shows that the name appearing in the URL,
the name of the "route" that maps a URL to a view,
and the name of the view, can all be different. More on routes later.

Earlier we saw ``config.add_view`` as one way to configure a view. This
section introduces ``@view_config``. Pyramid's configuration supports
:term:`imperative configuration`, such as the
``config.add_view`` in the previous example. You can also use
:term:`declarative configuration`, in which a Python
:term:`python:decorator`
is placed on the line above the view. Both approaches result in the
same final configuration, thus usually, it is simply a matter of taste.

Extra Credit
============

#. What does the dot in ``.views`` signify?

#. Why might ``assertIn`` be a better choice in testing the text in
   responses than ``assertEqual``?
