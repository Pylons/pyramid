The Pyramid Web Framework
=========================

:app:`Pyramid` is a small, fast, down-to-earth Python web framework.  It
is developed as part of the `Pylons Project
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/>`_.  It is licensed under a `BSD-like license
<http://repoze.org/license.html>`_.

Here is one of the simplest :app:`Pyramid` applications you can make:

.. literalinclude:: narr/helloworld.py

After you install :app:`Pyramid` and run this application, when you visit
`<http://localhost:8080/hello/world>`_ in a browser, you will see the text
``Hello, world!``

See :ref:`firstapp_chapter` for a full explanation of how this application
works. Read the :ref:`html_narrative_documentation` to understand how
:app:`Pyramid` is designed to scale from simple applications like this to
very large web applications.  To just dive in headfirst, read the 
:doc:`quick_tour`.

* :doc:`quick_tour` goes through the major features in Pyramid, covering
  a little about a lot.

* :doc:`quick_tutorial/index` does the same, but in a tutorial format:
  deeper treatment of each topic and with working code.

* To see a minimal Pyramid web application, check out
  :ref:`firstapp_chapter`.

* For help getting Pyramid set up, try
