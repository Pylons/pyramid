The Pyramid Web Application Development Framework
=================================================

:app:`Pyramid` is a small, fast, down-to-earth Python web application
development framework.  It is developed as part of the `Pylons Project
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/>`_.  It is licensed under a `BSD-like license
<http://repoze.org/license.html>`_.

Here is one of the simplest :app:`Pyramid` applications you can make:

.. literalinclude:: narr/helloworld.py

After you install :app:`Pyramid` and run this application, when you visit
`<http://localhost:8080/hello/world>`_ in a browser, you will see the text
``Hello, world!``

See :ref:`firstapp_chapter` for a full explanation of how this application
works. Read the :ref:`html_narrative_documentation` to understand how
:app:`Pyramid` is designed to scale from simple applications like this to
very large web applications.

Sample Applications
===================

.. note::

   These applications run only on Python 2.x, and so do some of their
   dependencies.

`cluegun <https://github.com/Pylons/cluegun>`_ is a simple pastebin
application based on Rocky Burt's `ClueBin
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ClueBin/0.2.3>`_.  It demonstrates form
processing, security, and the use of :term:`ZODB` within a :app:`Pyramid`
application.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/cluegun.git

`virginia <https://github.com/Pylons/virginia>`_ is a very simple dynamic
file rendering application.  It is willing to render structured text
documents, HTML documents, and images from a filesystem directory.
It's also a good example of :term:`traversal`. An
earlier version of this application runs the `repoze.org
<http://repoze.org>`_ website.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/virginia.git

`shootout <https://github.com/Pylons/shootout>`_ is an example "idea
competition" application by Carlos de la Guardia and Lukasz Fidosz.  It
demonstrates :term:`URL dispatch`, simple authentication, integration
with `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ and ``pyramid_simpleform``.
Check this application out of version control via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/shootout.git

`KARL <http://karlproject.org>`_ is a moderately-sized application (roughly
80K lines of Python code) built on top of :app:`Pyramid`.  It is an open
source web system for collaboration, organizational intranets, and knowledge
management. It provides facilities for wikis, calendars, manuals, searching,
tagging, commenting, and file uploads.  See the `KARL site
<http://karlproject.org>`_ for download and installation details.

Support and Development
=======================

The `Pylons Project web site <http://pylonsproject.org/>`_ is the main online
source of :app:`Pyramid` support and development information.
