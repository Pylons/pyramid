Sample Applications
===================

`cluegun <https://github.com/Pylons/cluegun>`_ is a simple pastebin
application based on Rocky Burt's `ClueBin
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ClueBin/0.2.3>`_.  It demonstrates form
processing, security, and the use of :term:`ZODB` within a :app:`Pyramid`
application.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/cluegun.git

`virginia <https://github.com/Pylons/virginia>`_ is a very simple dynamic
file rendering application.  It is willing to render structured text
documents, HTML documents, and images from a filesystem directory.  An
earlier version of this application runs the `repoze.org
<http://repoze.org>`_ website.  Check this application out via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/virginia.git

`shootout <https://github.com/Pylons/shootout>`_ is an example "idea
competition" application by Carlos de la Guardia and Lukasz Fidosz.  It
demonstrates :term:`URL dispatch`, simple authentication, integration
with `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ and ``pyramid_simpleform``.
Check this application out of version control via:

.. code-block:: text

  git clone git://github.com/Pylons/shootout.git

Older Sample Applications (repoze.bfg)
======================================

.. note::

   These applications are for an older version of :app:`Pyramid`, which was
   named :mod:`repoze.bfg`.  They won't work unmodified under Pyramid, but
   might provide useful clues.

`bfgsite <http://svn.repoze.org/bfgsite/trunk>`_ is the software which
runs the `bfg.repoze.org <http://bfg.repoze.org>`_ website.  It
demonstrates integration with Trac, and includes several
mini-applications such as a pastebin and tutorial engine.  Check a
buildout for this application out of Subversion via:

.. code-block:: text

  svn co http://svn.repoze.org/buildouts/bfgsite/ bfgsite_buildout

`KARL <http://karlproject.org>`_ is a moderately-sized application
(roughly 70K lines of Python code) built on top of :mod:`repoze.bfg`
and other Repoze software.  It is an open source web system for
collaboration, organizational intranets, and knowledge management, It
provides facilities for wikis, calendars, manuals, searching, tagging,
commenting, and file uploads.  See the `KARL site
<http://karlproject.org>`_ for download and installation details.
