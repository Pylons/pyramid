============
Installation
============

Before you begin
----------------

This tutorial assumes that you have already followed the steps in
:ref:`installing_chapter`, except **do not create a virtualenv or install
Pyramid**.  Thereby you will satisfy the following requirements.

* A Python interpreter is installed on your operating system.
* :term:`virtualenv` is installed.
* :term:`pip` will be installed when we create a virtual environment.


Create directory to contain the project
---------------------------------------

We need a workspace for our project files.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir ~/pyramidtut

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> mkdir pyramidtut


Create and use a virtual Python environment
-------------------------------------------

Next let's create a ``virtualenv`` workspace for our project.  We will use the
``VENV`` environment variable instead of the absolute path of the virtual
environment.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export VENV=~/pyramidtut
   $ virtualenv $VENV

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> set VENV=c:\pyramidtut

Each version of Python uses different paths, so you will need to adjust the
path to the command for your Python version.

Python 2.7:

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv %VENV%

Python 3.5:

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> c:\Python35\Scripts\virtualenv %VENV%


Upgrade pip in the virtual environment
--------------------------------------

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pip install --upgrade pip

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> %VENV%\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip


Install Pyramid into the virtual Python environment
---------------------------------------------------

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/pip install pyramid

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> %VENV%\Scripts\pip install pyramid


Install SQLite3 and its development packages
--------------------------------------------

If you used a package manager to install your Python or if you compiled
your Python from source, then you must install SQLite3 and its
development packages.  If you downloaded your Python as an installer
from https://www.python.org, then you already have it installed and can skip
this step.

If you need to install the SQLite3 packages, then, for example, using
the Debian system and ``apt-get``, the command would be the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev


Change directory to your virtual Python environment
---------------------------------------------------

Change directory to the ``pyramidtut`` directory, which is both your workspace
and your virtual environment.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd pyramidtut

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\> cd pyramidtut


.. _sql_making_a_project:

Making a project
----------------

Your next step is to create a project.  For this tutorial we will use
the :term:`scaffold` named ``alchemy`` which generates an application
that uses :term:`SQLAlchemy` and :term:`URL dispatch`.

:app:`Pyramid` supplies a variety of scaffolds to generate sample projects. We
will use ``pcreate``, a script that comes with Pyramid, to create our project
using a scaffold.

By passing ``alchemy`` into the ``pcreate`` command, the script creates the
files needed to use SQLAlchemy. By passing in our application name
``tutorial``, the script inserts that application name into all the required
files. For example, ``pcreate`` creates the ``initialize_tutorial_db`` in the
``pyramidtut/bin`` directory.

The below instructions assume your current working directory is "pyramidtut".

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/pcreate -s alchemy tutorial

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut> %VENV%\Scripts\pcreate -s alchemy tutorial

.. note:: If you are using Windows, the ``alchemy`` scaffold may not deal
   gracefully with installation into a location that contains spaces in the
   path. If you experience startup problems, try putting both the virtualenv
   and the project into directories that do not contain spaces in their paths.



.. _installing_project_in_dev_mode:

Installing the project in development mode
------------------------------------------

In order to do development on the project easily, you must "register" the
project as a development egg in your workspace using the ``setup.py develop``
command. In order to do so, change directory to the ``tutorial`` directory that
you created in :ref:`sql_making_a_project`, and run the ``setup.py develop``
command using the virtualenv Python interpreter.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd tutorial
   $ $VENV/bin/pip install -e .

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut> cd tutorial
   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\pip install -e .

The console will show ``setup.py`` checking for packages and installing missing
packages. Success executing this command will show a line like the following::

   Finished processing dependencies for tutorial==0.0

.. _sql_running_tests:

Run the tests
-------------

After you've installed the project in development mode, you may run the tests
for the project.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py test -q

.. py.test? See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2104#issuecomment-155852046

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\python setup.py test -q

.. py.test? See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2104#issuecomment-155852046

For a successful test run, you should see output that ends like this::

   ..
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 2 tests in 0.053s

   OK

Expose test coverage information
--------------------------------

You can run the ``nosetests`` command to see test coverage information. This
runs the tests in the same way that ``setup.py test`` does, but provides
additional "coverage" information, exposing which lines of your project are
covered by the tests.

To get this functionality working, we'll need to install the ``nose`` and
``coverage`` packages into our ``virtualenv``:

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/easy_install nose coverage

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\easy_install nose coverage

Once ``nose`` and ``coverage`` are installed, we can run the tests with
coverage.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/nosetests --cover-package=tutorial --cover-erase --with-coverage

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\nosetests --cover-package=tutorial \
         --cover-erase --with-coverage

If successful, you will see output something like this::

   ..
   Name                         Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   tutorial.py                      8      6    25%   7-12
   tutorial/models.py              22      0   100%
   tutorial/models/meta.py          5      0   100%
   tutorial/models/mymodel.py       8      0   100%
   tutorial/scripts.py              0      0   100%
   tutorial/views.py                0      0   100%
   tutorial/views/default.py       12      0   100%
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   TOTAL                           55      6    89%
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 2 tests in 0.579s

   OK

Our package doesn't quite have 100% test coverage.


.. _initialize_db_wiki2:

Initializing the database
-------------------------

We need to use the ``initialize_tutorial_db`` :term:`console script` to
initialize our database.

.. note::

   The ``initialize_tutorial_db`` command does not perform a migration, but
   rather it simply creates missing tables and adds some dummy data. If you
   already have a database, you should delete it before running
   ``initialize_tutorial_db`` again.

.. note::

   The ``initialize_tutorial_db`` command is not performing a migration but
   rather simply creating missing tables and adding some dummy data. If you
   already have a database, you should delete it before running
   ``initialize_tutorial_db`` again.

Type the following command, making sure you are still in the ``tutorial``
directory (the directory with a ``development.ini`` in it):

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/initialize_tutorial_db development.ini

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\initialize_tutorial_db development.ini

The output to your console should be something like this::

   2016-02-21 23:57:41,793 INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine:1192][MainThread] SELECT CAST('test plain returns' AS VARCHAR(60)) AS anon_1

Success!  You should now have a ``tutorial.sqlite`` file in your current
working directory. This is an SQLite database with a single table defined in it
(``models``).

.. _wiki2-start-the-application:

Start the application
---------------------

Start the application.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ps1con

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\pserve development.ini --reload

.. note::

   Your OS firewall, if any, may pop up a dialog asking for authorization
   to allow python to accept incoming network connections.

If successful, you will see something like this on your console::

   Starting subprocess with file monitor
   Starting server in PID 82349.
   serving on http://127.0.0.1:6543

This means the server is ready to accept requests.


Visit the application in a browser
----------------------------------

In a browser, visit http://localhost:6543/.  You will see the generated
application's default page.

One thing you'll notice is the "debug toolbar" icon on right hand side of the
page.  You can read more about the purpose of the icon at
:ref:`debug_toolbar`.  It allows you to get information about your
application while you develop.


Decisions the ``alchemy`` scaffold has made for you
---------------------------------------------------

Creating a project using the ``alchemy`` scaffold makes the following
assumptions:

- You are willing to use :term:`SQLAlchemy` as a database access tool.

- You are willing to use :term:`URL dispatch` to map URLs to code.

- You want to use zope.sqlalchemy_, pyramid_tm_ and the transaction_ package
  to scope sessions to requests.

- You want to use pyramid_jinja2_ to render your templates.
  Different templating engines can be used but we had to choose one to
  make the tutorial. See :ref:`available_template_system_bindings` for some
  options.
- You want to use zope.sqlalchemy_, pyramid_tm_ and the transaction_ package to
  scope sessions to requests.

- You want to use pyramid_jinja2_ to render your templates. Different
  templating engines can be used, but we had to choose one to make this
  tutorial. See :ref:`available_template_system_bindings` for some options.

.. note::

   :app:`Pyramid` supports any persistent storage mechanism (e.g., object
   database or filesystem files). It also supports an additional mechanism to
   map URLs to code (:term:`traversal`). However, for the purposes of this
   tutorial, we'll only be using URL dispatch and SQLAlchemy.
