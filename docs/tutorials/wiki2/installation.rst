============
Installation
============

Before you begin
----------------

This tutorial assumes that you have already followed the steps in
:ref:`installing_chapter`, except **do not create a virtual environment or
install Pyramid**.  Thereby you will satisfy the following requirements.

* A Python interpreter is installed on your operating system.
* You've satisfied the :ref:`requirements-for-installing-packages`.


Install SQLite3 and its development packages
--------------------------------------------

If you used a package manager to install your Python or if you compiled your Python from source, then you must install SQLite3 and its development packages.  If you downloaded your Python as an installer from https://www.python.org, then you already have it installed and can skip this step.

If you need to install the SQLite3 packages, then, for example, using the Debian system and ``apt-get``, the command would be the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev


Install cookiecutter
--------------------
We will use a :term:`cookiecutter` to create a Python package project from a Python package project template.  See `Cookiecutter Installation <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for instructions.


Generate a Pyramid project from a cookiecutter
----------------------------------------------

We will create a Pyramid project in your home directory for UNIX or at the root for Windows. It is assumed you know the path to where you installed ``cookiecutter``. Issue the following commands and override the defaults in the prompts as follows.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\> cd \
    c:\> cookiecutter https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy

On all operating systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If prompted for the first item, accept the default ``yes`` by hitting return.

#. ``You've cloned ~/.cookiecutters/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy before. Is it
   okay to delete and re-clone it? [yes]:``
#. ``project_name [Pyramid Scaffold]: myproj``
#. ``repo_name [scaffold]: tutorial``


Change directory into your newly created project
------------------------------------------------

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd tutorial

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\> cd tutorial


Set and use a ``VENV`` environment variable
-------------------------------------------

We will set the ``VENV`` environment variable to the absolute path of the virtual environment, and use it going forward.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export VENV=~/tutorial

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\tutorial> set VENV=c:\tutorial


Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m venv $VENV

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

Each version of Python uses different paths, so you will need to adjust the path to the command for your Python version. Recent versions of the Python 3 installer for Windows now install a Python launcher.

Python 2.7:

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\tutorial> c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv %VENV%

Python 3.6:

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\tutorial> python -m venv %VENV%


Upgrade packaging tools in the virtual environment
--------------------------------------------------

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\pip install --upgrade pip setuptools


.. _installing_project_in_dev_mode:

Installing the project in development mode
------------------------------------------

In order to do development on the project easily, you must "register" the project as a development egg in your workspace. We will install testing requirements at the same time. We do so with the following command.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ $VENV/bin/pip install -e ".[testing]"

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

    c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\pip install -e ".[testing]"

On all operating systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The console will show ``pip`` checking for packages and installing missing packages. Success executing this command will show a line like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    Successfully installed Jinja2-2.8 Mako-1.0.6 MarkupSafe-0.23 \
    PasteDeploy-1.5.2 Pygments-2.1.3 SQLAlchemy-1.1.4 WebOb-1.6.3 \
    WebTest-2.0.24 beautifulsoup4-4.5.1 coverage-4.2 py-1.4.32 pyramid-1.7.3 \

    waitress-1.0.1 zope.deprecation-4.2.0 zope.interface-4.3.3 \
    zope.sqlalchemy-0.7.7

Testing requirements are defined in our project's ``setup.py`` file, in the ``tests_require`` and ``extras_require`` stanzas.

.. literalinclude:: src/installation/setup.py
   :language: python
   :lineno-match:
   :lines: 22-26

.. literalinclude:: src/installation/setup.py
   :language: python
   :lineno-match:
   :lines: 46-48


.. _sql_running_tests:

Run the tests
-------------

After you've installed the project in development mode as well as the testing
requirements, you may run the tests for the project. The following commands
provide options to py.test that specify the module for which its tests shall be
run, and to run py.test in quiet mode.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/py.test -q

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

   c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\py.test -q

For a successful test run, you should see output that ends like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   ..
   2 passed in 0.44 seconds


Expose test coverage information
--------------------------------

You can run the ``py.test`` command to see test coverage information. This
runs the tests in the same way that ``py.test`` does, but provides additional
:term:`coverage` information, exposing which lines of your project are covered by the
tests.

We've already installed the ``pytest-cov`` package into our virtual
environment, so we can run the tests with coverage.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/py.test --cov --cov-report=term-missing

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

   c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\py.test --cov --cov-report=term-missing

If successful, you will see output something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

Our package doesn't quite have 100% test coverage.


.. _test_and_coverage_cookiecutter_defaults_sql:

Test and coverage cookiecutter defaults
---------------------------------------

Cookiecutters include configuration defaults for ``py.test`` and test coverage.
These configuration files are ``pytest.ini`` and ``.coveragerc``, located at
the root of your package. Without these defaults, we would need to specify the
path to the module on which we want to run tests and coverage.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/py.test --cov=tutorial tutorial/tests.py -q

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

   c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\py.test --cov=tutorial tutorial\tests.py -q

py.test follows :ref:`conventions for Python test discovery
<pytest:test discovery>`, and the configuration defaults from the cookiecutter
tell ``py.test`` where to find the module on which we want to run tests and
coverage.

.. seealso:: See py.test's documentation for :ref:`pytest:usage` or invoke
   ``py.test -h`` to see its full set of options.


.. _initialize_db_wiki2:

Initializing the database
-------------------------

We need to use the ``initialize_tutorial_db`` :term:`console script` to
initialize our database.

.. note::

   The ``initialize_tutorial_db`` command does not perform a migration, but
   rather it simply creates missing tables and adds some dummy data. If you
   already have a database, you should delete it before running
   ``initialize_tutorial_db`` again.

Type the following command, making sure you are still in the ``tutorial``
directory (the directory with a ``development.ini`` in it):

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/initialize_tutorial_db development.ini

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

   c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\initialize_tutorial_db development.ini

The output to your console should be something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    2016-12-18 21:30:08,675 INFO  [sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine:1235][MainThread] SELECT CAST('test plain returns' AS VARCHAR(60)) AS anon_1

Success!  You should now have a ``tutorial.sqlite`` file in your current
working directory. This is an SQLite database with a single table defined in it
(``models``).

.. _wiki2-start-the-application:

Start the application
---------------------

Start the application. See :ref:`what_is_this_pserve_thing` for more
information on ``pserve``.

On UNIX
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ $VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload

On Windows
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: doscon

   c:\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\pserve development.ini --reload

.. note::

   Your OS firewall, if any, may pop up a dialog asking for authorization
   to allow python to accept incoming network connections.

If successful, you will see something like this on your console:

.. code-block:: text

    Starting subprocess with file monitor
    Starting server in PID 44078.
    Serving on http://localhost:6543
    Serving on http://localhost:6543

This means the server is ready to accept requests.


Visit the application in a browser
----------------------------------

In a browser, visit http://localhost:6543/. You will see the generated
application's default page.

One thing you'll notice is the "debug toolbar" icon on right hand side of the
page.  You can read more about the purpose of the icon at
:ref:`debug_toolbar`.  It allows you to get information about your
application while you develop.


Decisions the ``alchemy`` cookiecutter has made for you
-------------------------------------------------------

Creating a project using the ``alchemy`` cookiecutter makes the following
assumptions:

- You are willing to use SQLite for persistent storage, although almost any SQL database could be used with SQLAlchemy.

- You are willing to use :term:`SQLAlchemy` for a database access tool.

- You are willing to use :term:`URL dispatch` to map URLs to code.

- You want to use zope.sqlalchemy_, pyramid_tm_, and the transaction_ packages
  to scope sessions to requests.

- You want to use pyramid_jinja2_ to render your templates. Different
  templating engines can be used, but we had to choose one to make this
  tutorial. See :ref:`available_template_system_bindings` for some options.

.. note::

   :app:`Pyramid` supports any persistent storage mechanism (e.g., object
   database or filesystem files). It also supports an additional mechanism to
   map URLs to code (:term:`traversal`). However, for the purposes of this
   tutorial, we'll only be using :term:`URL dispatch` and :term:`SQLAlchemy`.
