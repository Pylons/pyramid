SQLAlchemy + URL Dispatch Wiki Tutorial
=======================================

This tutorial introduces a :term:`SQLAlchemy` and :term:`url dispatch` -based
:app:`Pyramid` application to a developer familiar with Python.  When the
tutorial is finished, the developer will have created a basic Wiki
application with authentication.

For cut and paste purposes, the source code for all stages of this
tutorial can be browsed on GitHub at `docs/tutorials/wiki2/src
<https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki2/src>`_,
which corresponds to the same location if you have Pyramid sources.
