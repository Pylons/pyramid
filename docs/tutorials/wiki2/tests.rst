============
Adding Tests
============

We will now add tests for the models and the views and a few functional
tests in the ``tests.py``.  Tests ensure that an application works, and
that it continues to work after changes are made in the future.



Testing the Models
==================

To test the model class ``Page`` we'll add a new ``PageModelTests``
class to our ``tests.py`` file that was generated as part of the
``alchemy`` scaffold.

Testing the Views
=================

We'll modify our ``tests.py`` file, adding tests for each view
function we added above.  As a result, we'll *delete* the
``ViewTests`` class that the ``alchemy`` scaffold provided, and add
four other test classes: ``ViewWikiTests``, ``ViewPageTests``,
``AddPageTests``, and ``EditPageTests``.  These test the
``view_wiki``, ``view_page``, ``add_page``, and ``edit_page`` views
respectively.

Functional tests
================

We'll test the whole application, covering security aspects that are not
tested in the unit tests, like logging in, logging out, checking that
the ``viewer`` user cannot add or edit pages, but the ``editor`` user
can, and so on.

Viewing the results of all our edits to ``tests.py``
====================================================

Once we're done with the ``tests.py`` module, it will look a lot like:

.. literalinclude:: src/tests/tutorial/tests.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python

Running the Tests
=================

We can run these tests by using ``setup.py test`` in the same way we did in
:ref:`running_tests`.  However, first we must edit our ``setup.py`` to
include a dependency on WebTest, which we've used in our ``tests.py``.
Change the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` to include ``WebTest``.

.. literalinclude:: src/tests/setup.py
   :linenos:
   :language: python
   :lines: 11-22
   :emphasize-lines: 11

After we've added a dependency on WebTest in ``setup.py``, we need to rerun
``setup.py develop`` to get WebTest installed into our virtualenv.  Assuming
our shell's current working directory is the "tutorial" distribution
directory:

On UNIX:

.. code-block:: text

   $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop

On Windows:

.. code-block:: text

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\python setup.py develop

Once that command has completed successfully, we can run the tests
themselves:

On UNIX:

.. code-block:: text

   $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py test -q

On Windows:

.. code-block:: text

   c:\pyramidtut\tutorial> %VENV%\Scripts\python setup.py test -q

The expected result ends something like:

.. code-block:: text
