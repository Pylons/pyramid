ZODB + Traversal Wiki Tutorial
==============================

This tutorial introduces a :term:`ZODB` and :term:`traversal`-based
:app:`Pyramid` application to a developer familiar with Python.  It will be
most familiar to developers with previous :term:`Zope` experience.  When the
is finished, the developer will have created a basic Wiki application with
authentication.

For cut and paste purposes, the source code for all stages of this
tutorial can be browsed on GitHub at `docs/tutorials/wiki/src
<https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki/src>`_,
which corresponds to the same location if you have Pyramid sources.
