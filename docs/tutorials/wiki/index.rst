ZODB + Traversal Wiki Tutorial
==============================

This tutorial introduces a :term:`traversal` -based :app:`Pyramid`
application to a developer familiar with Python.  It will be most familiar to
developers with previous :term:`Zope` experience.  When we're done with the
tutorial, the developer will have created a basic Wiki application with
authentication.
