ZODB + Traversal Wiki Tutorial
==============================

This tutorial introduces a :term:`traversal` -based :app:`Pyramid`
application to a developer familiar with Python.  It will be most familiar to
developers with previous :term:`Zope` experience.  When we're done with the
tutorial, the developer will have created a basic Wiki application with
authentication.

For cut and paste purposes, the source code for all stages of this
tutorial can be browsed on GitHub at `docs/tutorials/wiki/src
<https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki/src>`_,
which corresponds to the same location if you have Pyramid sources.
