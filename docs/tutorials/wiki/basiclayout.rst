============
Basic Layout
============

The starter files generated by the ``zodb`` scaffold are basic, but
they provide a good orientation for the high-level patterns common to most
:term:`traversal` -based :app:`Pyramid` (and :term:`ZODB` based) projects.

The source code for this tutorial stage can be browsed via
`http://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki/src/basiclayout/
<http://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/tree/master/docs/tutorials/wiki/src/basiclayout/>`_.

Application Configuration with ``__init__.py``
------------------------------------------------

A directory on disk can be turned into a Python :term:`package` by containing
an ``__init__.py`` file.  Even if empty, this marks a directory as a Python
package.  Our application uses ``__init__.py`` as both a package marker, as
well as to contain application configuration code.

When you run the application using the ``pserve`` command using the
``development.ini`` generated config file, the application configuration
points at a Setuptools *entry point* described as ``egg:tutorial``.  In our
application, because the application's ``setup.py`` file says so, this entry
point happens to be the ``main`` function within the file named
``__init__.py``:

   .. literalinclude:: src/basiclayout/tutorial/__init__.py
      :linenos:
      :language: py

#. *Lines 1-3*.  Perform some dependency imports.

#. *Lines 5-7*  Define a root factory for our Pyramid application.

#. *Line 12*.  We construct a :term:`Configurator` with a :term:`root
   factory` and the settings keywords parsed by :term:`PasteDeploy`.  The root
   factory is named ``root_factory``.

#. *Line 13*.  Register a 'static view' which answers requests which start
   with with URL path ``/static`` using the
   :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_static_view method`.  This
   statement registers a view that will serve up static assets, such as CSS
   and image files, for us, in this case, at
   ``http://localhost:6543/static/`` and below.  The first argument is the
   "name" ``static``, which indicates that the URL path prefix of the view
   will be ``/static``.  the The second argument of this tag is the "path",
   which is a relative :term:`asset specification`, so it finds the resources
   it should serve within the ``static`` directory inside the ``tutorial``
   package.  The scaffold could have alternately used an *absolute* asset
   specification as the path (``tutorial:static``) but it does not.

#. *Line 14*.  Perform a :term:`scan`.  A scan will find :term:`configuration
   decoration`, such as view configuration decorators (e.g. ``@view_config``)
   in the source code of the ``tutorial`` package and will take actions based
   on these decorators.  We don't pass any arguments to
   :meth:`~pyramid.config.Configurator.scan`, which implies that the scan
   should take place in the current package (in this case, ``tutorial``).
   The scaffold could have equivalently said ``config.scan('tutorial')`` but
   it chose to omit the package name argument.

#. *Line 15*.  Use the
   :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.make_wsgi_app` method
   to return a :term:`WSGI` application.

Resources and Models with ``models.py``
---------------------------------------

:app:`Pyramid` uses the word :term:`resource` to describe objects arranged
hierarchically in a :term:`resource tree`.  This tree is consulted by
:term:`traversal` to map URLs to code.  In this application, the resource
tree represents the site structure, but it *also* represents the
:term:`domain model` of the application, because each resource is a node
stored persistently in a :term:`ZODB` database.  The ``models.py`` file is
where the ``zodb`` scaffold put the classes that implement our
resource objects, each of which happens also to be a domain model object.

Here is the source for ``models.py``:

   .. literalinclude:: src/basiclayout/tutorial/models.py
      :linenos:
      :language: py

#. *Lines 3-4*.  The ``MyModel`` :term:`resource` class is implemented here.
   Instances of this class will be capable of being persisted in :term:`ZODB`
   because the class inherits from the
   :class:`persistent.mapping.PersistentMapping` class.  The ``__parent__``
   and ``__name__`` are important parts of the :term:`traversal` protocol.
   By default, have these as ``None`` indicating that this is the
   :term:`root` object.

#. *Lines 6-12*.  ``appmaker`` is used to return the *application
   root* object.  It is called on *every request* to the
   :app:`Pyramid` application.  It also performs bootstrapping by
   *creating* an application root (inside the ZODB root object) if one
   does not already exist.  It is used by the "root_factory" we've defined
   in our ``__init__.py``.
 
   We do so by first seeing if the database has the persistent
   application root.  If not, we make an instance, store it, and
   commit the transaction.  We then return the application root
   object.

Views With ``views.py``
-----------------------

Our scaffold generated a default ``views.py`` on our behalf.  It
contains a single view, which is used to render the page shown when you visit
the URL ``http://localhost:6543/``.

Here is the source for ``views.py``:

   .. literalinclude:: src/basiclayout/tutorial/views.py
      :linenos:
      :language: py

Let's try to understand the components in this module:

#. *Lines 1-2*. Perform some dependency imports.

#. *Line 4*.  Use the :func:`pyramid.view.view_config` :term:`configuration
   decoration` to perform a :term:`view configuration` registration.  This
   view configuration registration will be activated when the application is
   started.  It will be activated by virtue of it being found as the result
   of a :term:`scan` (when Line 14 of ``__init__.py`` is run).

   The ``@view_config`` decorator accepts a number of keyword arguments.  We
   use two keyword arguments here: ``context`` and ``renderer``.

   The ``context`` argument signifies that the decorated view callable should
   only be run when :term:`traversal` finds the ``tutorial.models.MyModel``
   :term:`resource` to be the :term:`context` of a request.  In English, this
   means that when the URL ``/`` is visited, because ``MyModel`` is the root
   model, this view callable will be invoked.

   The ``renderer`` argument names an :term:`asset specification` of
   ``templates/mytemplate.pt``.  This asset specification points at a
   :term:`Chameleon` template which lives in the ``mytemplate.pt`` file
   within the ``templates`` directory of the ``tutorial`` package.  And
   indeed if you look in the ``templates`` directory of this package, you'll
   see a ``mytemplate.pt`` template file, which renders the default home page
   of the generated project.  This asset specification is *relative* (to the
   view.py's current package).  We could have alternately an used the
   absolute asset specification ``tutorial:templates/mytemplate.pt``, but
   chose to use the relative version.

   Since this call to ``@view_config`` doesn't pass a ``name`` argument, the
   ``my_view`` function which it decorates represents the "default" view
   callable used when the context is of the type ``MyModel``.

#. *Lines 5-6*.  We define a :term:`view callable` named ``my_view``, which
   we decorated in the step above.  This view callable is a *function* we
   write generated by the ``zodb`` scaffold that is given a
   ``request`` and which returns a dictionary.  The ``mytemplate.pt``
   :term:`renderer` named by the asset specification in the step above will
   convert this dictionary to a :term:`response` on our behalf.

   The function returns the dictionary ``{'project':'tutorial'}``.  This
   dictionary is used by the template named by the ``mytemplate.pt`` asset
   specification to fill in certain values on the page.

Configuration in ``development.ini``
------------------------------------

The ``development.ini`` (in the tutorial :term:`project` directory, as
opposed to the tutorial :term:`package` directory) looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: src/views/development.ini
   :language: ini

Note the existence of an ``[app:main]`` section which specifies our WSGI
application.  Our ZODB database settings are specified as the
``zodbconn.uri`` setting within this section.  This value, and the other
values within this section are passed as ``**settings`` to the ``main``
function we defined in ``__init__.py`` when the server is started via
``pserve``.
