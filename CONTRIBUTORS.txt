 Pylons Project Contributor Agreement
====================================

The submitter agrees by adding his or her name within the section below named
"Contributors" and submitting the resulting modified document to the
canonical shared repository location for this software project (whether

or she is signing a contract electronically.  The submitter becomes a
Contributor after a) he or she signs this document by adding their name
beneath the "Contributors" section below, and b) the resulting document is

Treatment of Account
---------------------

Contributor will not allow anyone other than the Contributor to use his or
her username or source repository login to submit code to a Pylons Project
source repository. Should Contributor become aware of any such use,
Contributor will immediately by notifying Agendaless Consulting.
Notification must be performed by sending an email to
webmaster@agendaless.com.  Until such notice is received, Contributor will be
presumed to have taken all actions made through Contributor's account. If the
Contributor has direct commit access, Agendaless Consulting will have
complete control and discretion over capabilities assigned to Contributor's
account, and may disable Contributor's account for any reason at any time.
