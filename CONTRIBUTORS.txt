Pylons Project Contributor Agreement
====================================

The submitter agrees by adding his or her name within the section below named
"Contributors" and submitting the resulting modified document to the
canonical shared repository location for this software project (whether
directly, as a user with "direct commit access", or via a "pull request"), he
or she is signing a contract electronically.  The submitter becomes a
Contributor after a) he or she signs this document by adding their name
beneath the "Contributors" section below, and b) the resulting document is
accepted into the canonical version control repository.

Treatment of Account
---------------------

Contributor will not allow anyone other than the Contributor to use his or
her username or source repository login to submit code to a Pylons Project
source repository. Should Contributor become aware of any such use,
Contributor will immediately notify Agendaless Consulting.
Notification must be performed by sending an email to
webmaster@agendaless.com.  Until such notice is received, Contributor will be
presumed to have taken all actions made through Contributor's account. If the
Contributor has direct commit access, Agendaless Consulting will have
complete control and discretion over capabilities assigned to Contributor's
account, and may disable Contributor's account for any reason at any time.

Legal Effect of Contribution
----------------------------

Upon submitting a change or new work to a Pylons Project source Repository (a
"Contribution"), you agree to assign, and hereby do assign, a one-half
interest of all right, title and interest in and to copyright and other
intellectual property rights with respect to your new and original portions
of the Contribution to Agendaless Consulting. You and Agendaless Consulting
each agree that the other shall be free to exercise any and all exclusive
rights in and to the Contribution, without accounting to one another,
including without limitation, the right to license the Contribution to others
under the Repoze Public License. This agreement shall run with title to the
Contribution. Agendaless Consulting does not convey to you any right, title
or interest in or to the Program or such portions of the Contribution that
were taken from the Program. Your transmission of a submission to the Pylons
Project source Repository and marks of identification concerning the
Contribution itself constitute your intent to contribute and your assignment
of the work in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

License Terms
-------------

Code committed to the Pylons Project source repository (Committed Code) must
be governed by the Repoze Public License (http://repoze.org/LICENSE.txt, aka
"the RPL") or another license acceptable to Agendaless Consulting.  Until
Agendaless Consulting declares in writing an acceptable license other than
the RPL, only the RPL shall be used.  A list of exceptions is detailed within
the "Licensing Exceptions" section of this document, if one exists.

Representations, Warranty, and Indemnification
----------------------------------------------

Contributor represents and warrants that the Committed Code does not violate
the rights of any person or entity, and that the Contributor has legal
authority to enter into this Agreement and legal authority over Contributed
Code. Further, Contributor indemnifies Agendaless Consulting against
violations.

Cryptography

Contributor understands that cryptographic code may be subject to government
regulations with which Agendaless Consulting and/or entities using Committed
Code must comply. Any code which contains any of the items listed below must
not be checked-in until Agendaless Consulting staff has been notified and has
approved such contribution in writing.
