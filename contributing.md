Prerequisites
-------------

Follow the instructions in HACKING.txt for your version or branch located in
the [root of the Pyramid repository](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/) to
install Pyramid and the tools needed to run its tests and build its
documentation.

Building documentation for a Pylons Project project
---------------------------------------------------

*Note:* These instructions might not work for Windows users. Suggestions to
improve the process for Windows users are welcome by submitting an issue or a
pull request. Windows users may find it helpful to follow the guide [Installing
Pyramid on a Windows
System](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/install.html#installing-pyramid-on-a-windows-system).

1.  Fork the repo on GitHub by clicking the [Fork] button.
2.  Clone your fork into a workspace on your local machine.

         git clone git@github.com:<username>/pyramid.git

3.  Change directories into the cloned repository

         cd pyramid

4.  Add a git remote "upstream" for the cloned fork.

         git remote add upstream git@github.com:Pylons/pyramid.git

5.  Create a virtual environment and set an environment variable as instructed in the
    [prerequisites](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/blob/master/HACKING.txt#L55-L58).

         # Mac and Linux
         $ export VENV=~/hack-on-pyramid/env

         # Windows
         set VENV=c:\hack-on-pyramid\env

6.  Install `tox` into your virtual environment.

         $ $VENV/bin/pip install tox

7.  Try to build the docs in your workspace.

         $ $VENV/bin/tox -e docs

     When the build finishes, you'll find HTML documentation rendered in
     `.tox/docs/html`. An `epub` version will be in `.tox/docs/epub`. And the
     result of the tests that are run on the documentation will be in
     `.tox/docs/doctest`.

8.  From this point forward, follow the typical [git
    workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-a-good-git-workflow/).
    *Always* start by pulling from the upstream to get the most current changes.

         git pull upstream master

9.  Make a branch, make changes to the docs, and rebuild them as indicated above.

10.  Once you are satisfied with your changes and the documentation builds
     successfully without errors or warnings, then git commit and push them to
     your "origin" repository on GitHub.

         git commit -m "commit message"
         git push -u origin --all # first time only, subsequent can be just 'git push'.

11.  Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

12.  Repeat the process starting from Step 8.
