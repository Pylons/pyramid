class Configurator(object):
    """
    A Configurator is used to configure a :app:`Pyramid`
    :term:`application registry`.

    The Configurator accepts a number of arguments: ``registry``,
    ``package``, ``settings``, ``root_factory``, ``authentication_policy``,
    ``authorization_policy``, ``renderers`` ``debug_logger``,
    ``locale_negotiator``, ``request_factory``, ``renderer_globals_factory``,
    ``default_permission``, ``session_factory``, ``default_view_mapper``,
    ``autocommit``, and ``exceptionresponse_view``.

    If the ``registry`` argument is passed as a non-``None`` value, it
    must be an instance of the :class:`pyramid.registry.Registry`
    class representing the registry to configure.  If ``registry`` is
    ``None``, the configurator will create a
    :class:`pyramid.registry.Registry` instance itself; it will
    also perform some default configuration that would not otherwise
    be done.  After construction, the configurator may be used to add
    configuration to the registry.  The overall state of a registry is
    called the 'configuration state'.

    .. warning:: If a ``registry`` is passed to the Configurator
       constructor, all other constructor arguments except ``package``
       are ignored.

    If the ``package`` argument is passed, it must be a reference to a
    Python :term:`package` (e.g. ``sys.modules['thepackage']``) or a
    :term:`dotted Python name` to same.  This value is used as a basis
    to convert relative paths passed to various configuration methods,
    such as methods which accept a ``renderer`` argument, into
    absolute paths.  If ``None`` is passed (the default), the package
    is assumed to be the Python package in which the *caller* of the
    ``Configurator`` constructor lives.

    If the ``settings`` argument is passed, it should be a Python dictionary
    representing the deployment settings for this application.  These are
    later retrievable using the :attr:`pyramid.registry.Registry.settings`
    attribute (aka ``request.registry.settings``).

    If the ``root_factory`` argument is passed, it should be an object
    representing the default :term:`root factory` for your application
    or a :term:`dotted Python name` to same.  If it is ``None``, a
    default root factory will be used.

    If ``authentication_policy`` is passed, it should be an instance
    of an :term:`authentication policy` or a :term:`dotted Python
    name` to same.

    If ``authorization_policy`` is passed, it should be an instance of
    an :term:`authorization policy` or a :term:`dotted Python name` to
    same.

    .. note:: A ``ConfigurationError`` will be raised when an
       authorization policy is supplied without also supplying an
       authentication policy (authorization requires authentication).

    If ``renderers`` is passed, it should be a list of tuples
    representing a set of :term:`renderer` factories which should be
    configured into this application (each tuple representing a set of
    positional values that should be passed to
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_renderer`).  If
    it is not passed, a default set of renderer factories is used.

    If ``debug_logger`` is not passed, a default debug logger that
    logs to stderr will be used.  If it is passed, it should be an
    instance of the :class:`logging.Logger` (PEP 282) standard library
    class or a :term:`dotted Python name` to same.  The debug logger
    is used by :app:`Pyramid` itself to log warnings and
    authorization debugging information.

    If ``locale_negotiator`` is passed, it should be a :term:`locale
    negotiator` implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to
    same.  See :ref:`custom_locale_negotiator`.

    If ``request_factory`` is passed, it should be a :term:`request
    factory` implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to same.
    See :ref:`changing_the_request_factory`.  By default it is ``None``,
    which means use the default request factory.

    If ``renderer_globals_factory`` is passed, it should be a :term:`renderer
    globals` factory implementation or a :term:`dotted Python name` to same.
    See :ref:`adding_renderer_globals`.  By default, it is ``None``, which
    means use no renderer globals factory.

    .. warning::

       as of Pyramid 1.1, ``renderer_globals_factory`` is deprecated.  Instead,
       use a BeforeRender event subscriber as per :ref:`beforerender_event`.

    If ``default_permission`` is passed, it should be a
    :term:`permission` string to be used as the default permission for
    all view configuration registrations performed against this
    Configurator.  An example of a permission string:``'view'``.
    Adding a default permission makes it unnecessary to protect each
    view configuration with an explicit permission, unless your
    application policy requires some exception for a particular view.
    By default, ``default_permission`` is ``None``, meaning that view
    configurations which do not explicitly declare a permission will
    always be executable by entirely anonymous users (any
    authorization policy in effect is ignored).  See also
    :ref:`setting_a_default_permission`.

    If ``session_factory`` is passed, it should be an object which
    implements the :term:`session factory` interface.  If a nondefault
    value is passed, the ``session_factory`` will be used to create a
    session object when ``request.session`` is accessed.  Note that
    the same outcome can be achieved by calling
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_session_factory`.  By
    default, this argument is ``None``, indicating that no session
    factory will be configured (and thus accessing ``request.session``
    will throw an error) unless ``set_session_factory`` is called later
    during configuration.

    If ``autocommit`` is ``True``, every method called on the configurator
    will cause an immediate action, and no configuration conflict detection
    will be used. If ``autocommit`` is ``False``, most methods of the
    configurator will defer their action until
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.commit` is called.  When
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.commit` is called, the actions implied
    by the called methods will be checked for configuration conflicts unless
    ``autocommit`` is ``True``.  If a conflict is detected a
    ``ConfigurationConflictError`` will be raised.  Calling
    :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.make_wsgi_app` always implies a final
    commit.

    If ``default_view_mapper`` is passed, it will be used as the default
    :term:`view mapper` factory for view configurations that don't otherwise
    specify one (see :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IViewMapperFactory`).  If a
    default_view_mapper is not passed, a superdefault view mapper will be
    used.

    If ``exceptionresponse_view`` is passed, it must be a :term:`view
    callable` or ``None``.  If it is a view callable, it will be used as an
    exception view callable when an :term:`exception response` is raised. If
    ``exceptionresponse_view`` is ``None``, no exception response view will
    be registered, and all raised exception responses will be bubbled up to
    Pyramid's caller.  By
    default, the ``pyramid.httpexceptions.default_exceptionresponse_view``
    function is used as the ``exceptionresponse_view``.  This argument is new
    in Pyramid 1.1.  """

        code which runs as the result of calling the callable should invoke
        methods on the configurator passed to it which add configuration
        state.  The return value of a callable will be ignored.

        Values allowed to be presented via the ``*callables`` argument to

        name` which resolves to a callable Python object.  It may also be a
        Python :term:`module`, in which case, the module will be searched for
        a callable named ``includeme``, which will be treated as the
        configuration callable.

               config.add_view(my_view)

        You might cause it be included within your Pyramid application like
        so:

        .. code-block:: python

           framework extension authors, not by :app:`Pyramid` application
           developers.

        This is API is useful to framework extenders who create
        pluggable systems which need to register 'proxy' view
        callables for functions, instances, or classes which meet the
        requirements of being a :app:`Pyramid` view callable.  For
        example, a ``some_other_framework`` function in another
        framework may want to allow a user to supply a view callable,
        but he may want to wrap the view callable in his own before
        registering the wrapper as a :app:`Pyramid` view callable.
        Because a :app:`Pyramid` view callable can be any of a
        number of valid objects, the framework extender will not know
        how to call the user-supplied object.  Running it through
        ``derive_view`` normalizes it to a callable which accepts two
        arguments: ``context`` and ``request``.

        For example:

        .. code-block:: python

           def some_other_framework(user_supplied_view):
               config = Configurator(reg)
               proxy_view = config.derive_view(user_supplied_view)
               def my_wrapper(context, request):
                   do_something_that_mutates(request)
                   return proxy_view(context, request)
               config.add_view(my_wrapper)

        The ``view`` object provided should be one of the following:

        - A function or another non-class callable object that accepts
          a :term:`request` as a single positional argument and which
          returns a :term:`response` object.

        - A function or other non-class callable object that accepts
          two positional arguments, ``context, request`` and which
          returns a :term:`response` object.

        - A class which accepts a single positional argument in its
          constructor named ``request``, and which has a ``__call__``
          method that accepts no arguments that returns a
          :term:`response` object.

        - A class which accepts two positional arguments named
          ``context, request``, and which has a ``__call__`` method
          that accepts no arguments that returns a :term:`response`
          object.

        - A :term:`dotted Python name` which refers to any of the
          kinds of objects above.

        This API returns a callable which accepts the arguments
        ``context, request`` and which returns the result of calling
        the provided ``view`` object.

        The ``attr`` keyword argument is most useful when the view
        object is a class.  It names the method that should be used as
        the callable.  If ``attr`` is not provided, the attribute
        effectively defaults to ``__call__``.  See
        :ref:`class_as_view` for more information.

        The ``renderer`` keyword argument should be a renderer
        name. If supplied, it will cause the returned callable to use
        a :term:`renderer` to convert the user-supplied view result to
        a :term:`response` object.  If a ``renderer`` argument is not
        supplied, the user-supplied view must itself return a

        which the view callable will be invoked when a request is
        presented to :app:`Pyramid`; non-predicate arguments are
        informational.

        Non-Predicate Arguments

        view

          A :term:`view callable` or a :term:`dotted Python name`
          which refers to a view callable.  This argument is required
          unless a ``renderer`` argument also exists.  If a
          ``renderer`` argument is passed, and a ``view`` argument is
          not provided, the view callable defaults to a callable that
          returns an empty dictionary (see
          :ref:`views_which_use_a_renderer`).

        permission

          The name of a :term:`permission` that the user must possess
          in order to invoke the :term:`view callable`.  See
          :ref:`view_security_section` for more information about view
          security and permissions.  If ``permission`` is omitted, a
          *default* permission may be used for this view registration
          if one was named as the
          :class:`pyramid.config.Configurator` constructor's
          ``default_permission`` argument, or if
          :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_default_permission`
          was used prior to this view registration.  Pass the string
          ``__no_permission_required__`` as the permission argument to
          explicitly indicate that the view should always be
          executable by entirely anonymous users, regardless of the
          default permission, bypassing any :term:`authorization
          policy` that may be in effect.

        attr

          The view machinery defaults to using the ``__call__`` method
          of the :term:`view callable` (or the function itself, if the
          view callable is a function) to obtain a response.  The
          ``attr`` value allows you to vary the method attribute used
          to obtain the response.  For example, if your view was a
          class, and the class has a method named ``index`` and you
          wanted to use this method instead of the class' ``__call__``
          method to return the response, you'd say ``attr="index"`` in the
          view configuration for the view.  This is
          most useful when the view definition is a class.

        renderer

          This is either a single string term (e.g. ``json``) or a
          string implying a path or :term:`asset specification`
          (e.g. ``templates/views.pt``) naming a :term:`renderer`
          implementation.  If the ``renderer`` value does not contain
          a dot ``.``, the specified string will be used to look up a
          renderer implementation, and that renderer implementation
          will be used to construct a response from the view return
          value.  If the ``renderer`` value contains a dot (``.``),
          the specified term will be treated as a path, and the
          filename extension of the last element in the path will be
          used to look up the renderer implementation, which will be
          passed the full path.  The renderer implementation will be
          used to construct a :term:`response` from the view return
          value.

          Note that if the view itself returns a :term:`response` (see
          :ref:`the_response`), the specified renderer implementation
          is never called.

          When the renderer is a path, although a path is usually just
          a simple relative pathname (e.g. ``templates/foo.pt``,
          implying that a template named "foo.pt" is in the
          "templates" directory relative to the directory of the
          current :term:`package` of the Configurator), a path can be
          absolute, starting with a slash on UNIX or a drive letter
          prefix on Windows.  The path can alternately be a
          :term:`asset specification` in the form
          ``some.dotted.package_name:relative/path``, making it
          possible to address template assets which live in a
          separate package.

          The ``renderer`` attribute is optional.  If it is not
          defined, the "null" renderer is assumed (no rendering is
          performed and the value is passed back to the upstream
          :app:`Pyramid` machinery unmodified).

        http_cache

          .. note:: This feature is new as of Pyramid 1.1.

          When you supply an ``http_cache`` value to a view configuration,
          the ``Expires`` and ``Cache-Control`` headers of a response
          generated by the associated view callable are modified.  The value
          for ``http_cache`` may be one of the following:

          - A nonzero integer.  If it's a nonzero integer, it's treated as a
            number of seconds.  This number of seconds will be used to
            compute the ``Expires`` header and the ``Cache-Control:
            max-age`` parameter of responses to requests which call this view.
            For example: ``http_cache=3600`` instructs the requesting browser
            to 'cache this response for an hour, please'.

          - A ``datetime.timedelta`` instance.  If it's a
            ``datetime.timedelta`` instance, it will be converted into a
            number of seconds, and that number of seconds will be used to
            compute the ``Expires`` header and the ``Cache-Control:
            max-age`` parameter of responses to requests which call this view.
            For example: ``http_cache=datetime.timedelta(days=1)`` instructs
            the requesting browser to 'cache this response for a day, please'.

          - Zero (``0``).  If the value is zero, the ``Cache-Control`` and
            ``Expires`` headers present in all responses from this view will
            be composed such that client browser cache (and any intermediate
            caches) are instructed to never cache the response.

          - A two-tuple.  If it's a two tuple (e.g. ``http_cache=(1,
            {'public':True})``), the first value in the tuple may be a
            nonzero integer or a ``datetime.timedelta`` instance; in either
            case this value will be used as the number of seconds to cache
            the response.  The second value in the tuple must be a
            dictionary.  The values present in the dictionary will be used as
            input to the ``Cache-Control`` response header.  For example:
            ``http_cache=(3600, {'public':True})`` means 'cache for an hour,
            and add ``public`` to the Cache-Control header of the response'.
            All keys and values supported by the
            ``webob.cachecontrol.CacheControl`` interface may be added to the
            dictionary.  Supplying ``{'public':True}`` is equivalent to
            calling ``response.cache_control.public = True``.

          Providing a non-tuple value as ``http_cache`` is equivalent to
          calling ``response.cache_expires(value)`` within your view's body.

          Providing a two-tuple value as ``http_cache`` is equivalent to
          calling ``response.cache_expires(value[0], **value[1])`` within your
          view's body.

          If you wish to avoid influencing, the ``Expires`` header, and
          instead wish to only influence ``Cache-Control`` headers, pass a
          tuple as ``http_cache`` with the first element of ``None``, e.g.:
          ``(None, {'public':True})``.

          If you wish to prevent a view that uses ``http_cache`` in its
          configuration from having its caching response headers changed by
          this machinery, set ``response.cache_control.prevent_auto = True``
          before returning the response from the view.  This effectively
          disables any HTTP caching done by ``http_cache`` for that response.

        wrapper

          The :term:`view name` of a different :term:`view
          configuration` which will receive the response body of this
          view as the ``request.wrapped_body`` attribute of its own
          :term:`request`, and the :term:`response` returned by this
          view as the ``request.wrapped_response`` attribute of its
          own request.  Using a wrapper makes it possible to "chain"
          views together to form a composite response.  The response
          of the outermost wrapper view will be returned to the user.
          The wrapper view will be found as any view is found: see
          :ref:`view_lookup`.  The "best" wrapper view will be found
          based on the lookup ordering: "under the hood" this wrapper
          view is looked up via
          ``pyramid.view.render_view_to_response(context, request,
          'wrapper_viewname')``. The context and request of a wrapper
          view is the same context and request of the inner view.  If
          this attribute is unspecified, no view wrapping is done.

        decorator

          A :term:`dotted Python name` to function (or the function itself)
          which will be used to decorate the registered :term:`view
          callable`.  The decorator function will be called with the view
          callable as a single argument.  The view callable it is passed will
          accept ``(context, request)``.  The decorator must return a
          replacement view callable which also accepts ``(context,
          request)``.

        mapper

          A Python object or :term:`dotted Python name` which refers to a
          :term:`view mapper`, or ``None``.  By default it is ``None``, which
          indicates that the view should use the default view mapper.  This
          plug-point is useful for Pyramid extension developers, but it's not
          very useful for 'civilians' who are just developing stock Pyramid
          applications. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

        Predicate Arguments

        name

          The :term:`view name`.  Read :ref:`traversal_chapter` to
          understand the concept of a view name.

        context

          An object or a :term:`dotted Python name` referring to an
          interface or class object that the :term:`context` must be
          an instance of, *or* the :term:`interface` that the
          :term:`context` must provide in order for this view to be
          found and called.  This predicate is true when the
          :term:`context` is an instance of the represented class or
          if the :term:`context` provides the represented interface;
          it is otherwise false.  This argument may also be provided
          to ``add_view`` as ``for_`` (an older, still-supported
          spelling).

        route_name

          This value must match the ``name`` of a :term:`route
          configuration` declaration (see :ref:`urldispatch_chapter`)
          that must match before this view will be called.

        request_type

          This value should be an :term:`interface` that the
          :term:`request` must provide in order for this view to be
          found and called.  This value exists only for backwards
          compatibility purposes.

        request_method

          This value can be one of the strings ``GET``,
          ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``, or ``HEAD`` representing an
          HTTP ``REQUEST_METHOD``.  A view declaration with this
          argument ensures that the view will only be called when the
          request's ``method`` attribute (aka the ``REQUEST_METHOD`` of
          the WSGI environment) string matches the supplied value.

        request_param

          This value can be any string.  A view declaration with this
          argument ensures that the view will only be called when the
          :term:`request` has a key in the ``request.params``
          dictionary (an HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST`` variable) that has a
          name which matches the supplied value.  If the value
          supplied has a ``=`` sign in it,
          e.g. ``request_param="foo=123"``, then the key (``foo``)
          must both exist in the ``request.params`` dictionary, *and*
          the value must match the right hand side of the expression
          (``123``) for the view to "match" the current request.

        containment

          This value should be a Python class or :term:`interface` (or a
          :term:`dotted Python name`) that an object in the
          :term:`lineage` of the context must provide in order for this view
          to be found and called.  The nodes in your object graph must be
          "location-aware" to use this feature.  See
          :ref:`location_aware` for more information about
          location-awareness.

        xhr

          This value should be either ``True`` or ``False``.  If this
          value is specified and is ``True``, the :term:`request`
          must possess an ``HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH`` (aka
          ``X-Requested-With``) header that has the value
          ``XMLHttpRequest`` for this view to be found and called.
          This is useful for detecting AJAX requests issued from
          jQuery, Prototype and other Javascript libraries.

        accept

          The value of this argument represents a match query for one
          or more mimetypes in the ``Accept`` HTTP request header.  If
          this value is specified, it must be in one of the following
          forms: a mimetype match token in the form ``text/plain``, a
          wildcard mimetype match token in the form ``text/*`` or a
          match-all wildcard mimetype match token in the form ``*/*``.
          If any of the forms matches the ``Accept`` header of the
          request, this predicate will be true.

        header

          This value represents an HTTP header name or a header
          name/value pair.  If the value contains a ``:`` (colon), it
          will be considered a name/value pair
          (e.g. ``User-Agent:Mozilla/.*`` or ``Host:localhost``).  The
          value portion should be a regular expression.  If the value
          does not contain a colon, the entire value will be
          considered to be the header name
          (e.g. ``If-Modified-Since``).  If the value evaluates to a
          header name only without a value, the header specified by
          the name must be present in the request for this predicate
          to be true.  If the value evaluates to a header name/value
          pair, the header specified by the name must be present in
          the request *and* the regular expression specified as the
          value must match the header value.  Whether or not the value
          represents a header name or a header name/value pair, the
          case of the header name is not significant.

        path_info

          This value represents a regular expression pattern that will
          be tested against the ``PATH_INFO`` WSGI environment
          variable.  If the regex matches, this predicate will be
          ``True``.


        custom_predicates

          This value should be a sequence of references to custom
          predicate callables.  Use custom predicates when no set of
          predefined predicates do what you need.  Custom predicates
          can be combined with predefined predicates as necessary.
          Each custom predicate callable should accept two arguments:
          ``context`` and ``request`` and should return either
          ``True`` or ``False`` after doing arbitrary evaluation of
          the context and/or the request.  If all callables return
          ``True``, the associated view callable will be considered
          viable for a given request.

        """ Add a :term:`route configuration` to the current
        configuration state, as well as possibly a :term:`view
        configuration` to be used to specify a :term:`view callable`
        that will be invoked when this route matches.  The arguments
        to this method are divided into *predicate*, *non-predicate*,
        and *view-related* types.  :term:`Route predicate` arguments
        narrow the circumstances in which a route will be match a
        request; non-predicate arguments are informational.

        Non-Predicate Arguments

        name

          The name of the route, e.g. ``myroute``.  This attribute is
          required.  It must be unique among all defined routes in a given
          application.

        factory

          A Python object (often a function or a class) or a :term:`dotted
          Python name` which refers to the same object that will generate a
          :app:`Pyramid` root resource object when this route matches. For
          example, ``mypackage.resources.MyFactory``.  If this argument is
          not specified, a default root factory will be used.

        traverse

          If you would like to cause the :term:`context` to be
          something other than the :term:`root` object when this route
          matches, you can spell a traversal pattern as the
          ``traverse`` argument.  This traversal pattern will be used
          as the traversal path: traversal will begin at the root
          object implied by this route (either the global root, or the
          object returned by the ``factory`` associated with this
          route).

          The syntax of the ``traverse`` argument is the same as it is
          for ``pattern``. For example, if the ``pattern`` provided to
          ``add_route`` is ``articles/{article}/edit``, and the
          ``traverse`` argument provided to ``add_route`` is
          ``/{article}``, when a request comes in that causes the route
          to match in such a way that the ``article`` match value is
          '1' (when the request URI is ``/articles/1/edit``), the
          traversal path will be generated as ``/1``.  This means that
          the root object's ``__getitem__`` will be called with the
          name ``1`` during the traversal phase.  If the ``1`` object
          exists, it will become the :term:`context` of the request.
          :ref:`traversal_chapter` has more information about
          traversal.

          If the traversal path contains segment marker names which
          are not present in the ``pattern`` argument, a runtime error
          will occur.  The ``traverse`` pattern should not contain
          segment markers that do not exist in the ``pattern``
          argument.

          A similar combining of routing and traversal is available
          when a route is matched which contains a ``*traverse``
          remainder marker in its pattern (see
          :ref:`using_traverse_in_a_route_pattern`).  The ``traverse``
          argument to add_route allows you to associate route patterns
          with an arbitrary traversal path without using a a
          ``*traverse`` remainder marker; instead you can use other
          match information.

          Note that the ``traverse`` argument to ``add_route`` is
          ignored when attached to a route that has a ``*traverse``
          remainder marker in its pattern.

        pregenerator

           This option should be a callable object that implements the
           :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IRoutePregenerator`
           interface.  A :term:`pregenerator` is a callable called by
           the :mod:`pyramid.url.route_url` function to augment or
           replace the arguments it is passed when generating a URL
           for the route.  This is a feature not often used directly
           by applications, it is meant to be hooked by frameworks
           that use :app:`Pyramid` as a base.

        use_global_views

          When a request matches this route, and view lookup cannot
          find a view which has a ``route_name`` predicate argument
          that matches the route, try to fall back to using a view
          that otherwise matches the context, request, and view name
          (but which does not match the route_name predicate).

        static

          If ``static`` is ``True``, this route will never match an incoming
          request; it will only be useful for URL generation.  By default,
          ``static`` is ``False``.  See :ref:`static_route_narr`.

          .. note:: New in :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

        Predicate Arguments

        pattern

          The pattern of the route e.g. ``ideas/{idea}``.  This
          argument is required.  See :ref:`route_pattern_syntax`
          for information about the syntax of route patterns.  If the
          pattern doesn't match the current URL, route matching
          continues.

          .. note::

             For backwards compatibility purposes (as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.0), a
             ``path`` keyword argument passed to this function will be used to
             represent the pattern value if the ``pattern`` argument is
             ``None``.  If both ``path`` and ``pattern`` are passed, ``pattern``
             wins.

        xhr

          This value should be either ``True`` or ``False``.  If this
          value is specified and is ``True``, the :term:`request` must
          possess an ``HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH`` (aka
          ``X-Requested-With``) header for this route to match.  This
          is useful for detecting AJAX requests issued from jQuery,
          Prototype and other Javascript libraries.  If this predicate
          returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        request_method

          A string representing an HTTP method name, e.g. ``GET``,
          ``POST``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``PUT``.  If this argument
          is not specified, this route will match if the request has
          *any* request method.  If this predicate returns ``False``,
          route matching continues.

        path_info

          This value represents a regular expression pattern that will
          be tested against the ``PATH_INFO`` WSGI environment
          variable.  If the regex matches, this predicate will return
          ``True``.  If this predicate returns ``False``, route
          matching continues.

        request_param

          This value can be any string.  A view declaration with this
          argument ensures that the associated route will only match
          when the request has a key in the ``request.params``
          dictionary (an HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST`` variable) that has a
          name which matches the supplied value.  If the value
          supplied as the argument has a ``=`` sign in it,
          e.g. ``request_param="foo=123"``, then the key
          (``foo``) must both exist in the ``request.params`` dictionary, and
          the value must match the right hand side of the expression (``123``)
          for the route to "match" the current request.  If this predicate
          returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        header

          This argument represents an HTTP header name or a header
          name/value pair.  If the argument contains a ``:`` (colon),
          it will be considered a name/value pair
          (e.g. ``User-Agent:Mozilla/.*`` or ``Host:localhost``).  If
          the value contains a colon, the value portion should be a
          regular expression.  If the value does not contain a colon,
          the entire value will be considered to be the header name
          (e.g. ``If-Modified-Since``).  If the value evaluates to a
          header name only without a value, the header specified by
          the name must be present in the request for this predicate
          to be true.  If the value evaluates to a header name/value
          pair, the header specified by the name must be present in
          the request *and* the regular expression specified as the
          value must match the header value.  Whether or not the value
          represents a header name or a header name/value pair, the
          case of the header name is not significant.  If this
          predicate returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        accept

          This value represents a match query for one or more
          mimetypes in the ``Accept`` HTTP request header.  If this
          value is specified, it must be in one of the following
          forms: a mimetype match token in the form ``text/plain``, a
          wildcard mimetype match token in the form ``text/*`` or a
          match-all wildcard mimetype match token in the form ``*/*``.
          If any of the forms matches the ``Accept`` header of the
          request, this predicate will be true.  If this predicate
          returns ``False``, route matching continues.

        custom_predicates

          This value should be a sequence of references to custom
          predicate callables.  Use custom predicates when no set of
          predefined predicates does what you need.  Custom predicates
          can be combined with predefined predicates as necessary.
          Each custom predicate callable should accept two arguments:
          ``info`` and ``request`` and should return either ``True``
          or ``False`` after doing arbitrary evaluation of the info
          and/or the request.  If all custom and non-custom predicate
          callables return ``True`` the associated route will be
          considered viable for a given request.  If any predicate
          callable returns ``False``, route matching continues.  Note
          that the value ``info`` passed to a custom route predicate
          is a dictionary containing matching information; see
          :ref:`custom_route_predicates` for more information about
          ``info``.

        View-Related Arguments

        .. warning::

           The arguments described below have been deprecated as of
           :app:`Pyramid` 1.1. *Do not use these for new development; they
           should only be used to support older code bases which depend upon
           them.* Use a separate call to
           :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view` to associate a view with
           a route using the ``route_name`` argument.

        view

          .. warning:: Deprecated as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

          A Python object or :term:`dotted Python name` to the same
          object that will be used as a view callable when this route
          matches. e.g. ``mypackage.views.my_view``.

        view_context

          .. warning:: Deprecated as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

          A class or an :term:`interface` or :term:`dotted Python
          name` to the same object which the :term:`context` of the
          view should match for the view named by the route to be
          used.  This argument is only useful if the ``view``
          attribute is used.  If this attribute is not specified, the
          default (``None``) will be used.

          If the ``view`` argument is not provided, this argument has
          no effect.

          This attribute can also be spelled as ``for_`` or ``view_for``.

        view_permission

          .. warning:: Deprecated as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

          The permission name required to invoke the view associated
          with this route.  e.g. ``edit``. (see
          :ref:`using_security_with_urldispatch` for more information
          about permissions).

          If the ``view`` attribute is not provided, this argument has
          no effect.

          This argument can also be spelled as ``permission``.

        view_renderer

          .. warning:: Deprecated as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

          This is either a single string term (e.g. ``json``) or a
          string implying a path or :term:`asset specification`
          (e.g. ``templates/views.pt``).  If the renderer value is a
          single term (does not contain a dot ``.``), the specified
          term will be used to look up a renderer implementation, and
          that renderer implementation will be used to construct a
          response from the view return value.  If the renderer term
          contains a dot (``.``), the specified term will be treated
          as a path, and the filename extension of the last element in
          the path will be used to look up the renderer
          implementation, which will be passed the full path.  The
          renderer implementation will be used to construct a response
          from the view return value.  See
          :ref:`views_which_use_a_renderer` for more information.

          If the ``view`` argument is not provided, this argument has
          no effect.

          This argument can also be spelled as ``renderer``.

        view_attr

          .. warning:: Deprecated as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.1.

          The view machinery defaults to using the ``__call__`` method
          of the view callable (or the function itself, if the view
          callable is a function) to obtain a response dictionary.
          The ``attr`` value allows you to vary the method attribute
          used to obtain the response.  For example, if your view was
          a class, and the class has a method named ``index`` and you
          wanted to use this method instead of the class' ``__call__``
          method to return the response, you'd say ``attr="index"`` in
          the view configuration for the view.  This is
          most useful when the view definition is a class.

          If the ``view`` argument is not provided, this argument has no
          effect.

        The ``name`` argument is a string representing an
        application-relative local URL prefix.  It may alternately be a full
        URL.

        The ``path`` argument is the path on disk where the static files
        reside.  This can be an absolute path, a package-relative path, or a
        :term:`asset specification`.

        The ``cache_max_age`` keyword argument is input to set the
        ``Expires`` and ``Cache-Control`` headers for static assets served.
        Note that this argument has no effect when the ``name`` is a *url
        prefix*.  By default, this argument is ``None``, meaning that no
        particular Expires or Cache-Control headers are set in the response.

        The ``permission`` keyword argument is used to specify the
        :term:`permission` required by a user to execute the static view.  By
        default, it is the string ``__no_permission_required__``.  The
        ``__no_permission_required__`` string is a special sentinel which
        indicates that, even if a :term:`default permission` exists for the
        current application, the static view should be renderered to
        completely anonymous users.  This default value is permissive
        because, in most web apps, static assets seldom need protection from
        viewing.  If ``permission`` is specified, the security checking will
        be performed against the default root factory ACL.

        Any other keyword arguments sent to ``add_static_view`` are passed on
        to :meth:`pyramid.config.Configuration.add_route` (e.g. ``factory``,
        perhaps to define a custom factory with a custom ACL for this static
        view).

        *Usage*

        The ``add_static_view`` function is typically used in conjunction
        with the :func:`pyramid.url.static_url` function.
        ``add_static_view`` adds a view which renders a static asset when
        some URL is visited; :func:`pyramid.url.static_url` generates a URL
        to that asset.

        The ``name`` argument to ``add_static_view`` is usually a :term:`view
        name`.  When this is the case, the :func:`pyramid.url.static_url` API
        will generate a URL which points to a Pyramid view, which will serve
        up a set of assets that live in the package itself. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

           add_static_view('images', 'mypackage:images/')

        Code that registers such a view can generate URLs to the view via
        :func:`pyramid.url.static_url`:

        .. code-block:: python

           static_url('mypackage:images/logo.png', request)

        When ``add_static_view`` is called with a ``name`` argument that
        represents a URL prefix, as it is above, subsequent calls to
        :func:`pyramid.url.static_url` with paths that start with the
        ``path`` argument passed to ``add_static_view`` will generate a URL
        something like ``http://<Pyramid app URL>/images/logo.png``, which
        will cause the ``logo.png`` file in the ``images`` subdirectory of
        the ``mypackage`` package to be served.

        ``add_static_view`` can alternately be used with a ``name`` argument
        which is a *URL*, causing static assets to be served from an external
        webserver.  This happens when the ``name`` argument is a fully
        qualified URL (e.g. starts with ``http://`` or similar).  In this
        mode, the ``name`` is used as the prefix of the full URL when
        generating a URL using :func:`pyramid.url.static_url`.  For example,
        if ``add_static_view`` is called like so:

        .. code-block:: python

           add_static_view('http://example.com/images', 'mypackage:images/')

        Subsequently, the URLs generated by :func:`pyramid.url.static_url`
        for that static view will be prefixed with
        ``http://example.com/images``:

        .. code-block:: python

           static_url('mypackage:images/logo.png', request)

        When ``add_static_view`` is called with a ``name`` argument that is
        the URL ``http://example.com/images``, subsequent calls to
        :func:`pyramid.url.static_url` with paths that start with the
        ``path`` argument passed to ``add_static_view`` will generate a URL
        something like ``http://example.com/logo.png``.  The external
        webserver listening on ``example.com`` must be itself configured to
        respond properly to such a request.

    # ----------
    #
    # Given an argument list, a predicate list is computed.
    # Predicates are added to a predicate list in (presumed)
    # computation expense order.  All predicates associated with a
    # view or route must evaluate true for the view or route to
    # "match" during a request.  Elsewhere in the code, we evaluate
    # predicates using a generator expression.  The fastest predicate
    # should be evaluated first, then the next fastest, and so on, as
    # if one returns false, the remainder of the predicates won't need
    # to be evaluated.
    #
    # While we compute predicates, we also compute a predicate hash
    # (aka phash) that can be used by a caller to identify identical
    # predicate lists.
    #
    # ORDERING
    # --------
    #
    # A "order" is computed for the predicate list.  An order is
    # a scoring.
    #
    # Each predicate is associated with a weight value, which is a
    # multiple of 2.  The weight of a predicate symbolizes the
    # relative potential "importance" of the predicate to all other
    # predicates.  A larger weight indicates greater importance.
    #
    # All weights for a given predicate list are bitwise ORed together
    # to create a "score"; this score is then subtracted from
    # MAX_ORDER and divided by an integer representing the number of
    # predicates+1 to determine the order.
    #
    # The order represents the ordering in which a "multiview" ( a
    # collection of views that share the same context/request/name
    # triad but differ in other ways via predicates) will attempt to
    # call its set of views.  Views with lower orders will be tried
    # first.  The intent is to a) ensure that views with more
    # predicates are always evaluated before views with fewer
    # predicates and b) to ensure a stable call ordering of views that
    # share the same number of predicates.  Views which do not have
    # any predicates get an order of MAX_ORDER, meaning that they will
