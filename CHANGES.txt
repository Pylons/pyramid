.. _changes_1.6.4:

1.6.4 (2016-08-17)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Oops, Apparently wheels do not build cleanly every time, so build artifacts
  from 1.7.1 creeped into the wheel for 1.6.3. Note to self: ``rm -rf build``.

.. _changes_1.6.3:

1.6.3 (2016-08-16)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Revert changes from #2706 released in Pyramid 1.6.2. JSON renderers will
  continue to return unicode data instead of UTF-8 encoded bytes. This means
  that WebOb responses are still expected to handle unicode data even though
  JSON does not have a charset.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2744

.. _changes_1.6.2:

1.6.2 (2016-08-16)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug in `proutes` such that it now shows the correct view when a class
  and `attr` is involved.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2687

- The JSON renderers now encode their result as UTF-8. The renderer helper
  will now warn the user and encode the result as UTF-8 if a renderer returns a
  text type and the response does not have a valid character set. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2706

.. _changes_1.6.1:

1.6.1 (2016-02-02)
==================

Deprecations
------------

- Missed the deprecation of one more daemon/process management feature that
  allowed logging to a file. This deprecates ``--log-file`` which is generally
  only used with pserve running in daemon mode. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2330

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix an issue with differing CSRF token data types on Python runtimes
  supporting ``hmac.compare_digest``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2299

1.6 (2016-01-03)
================

Deprecations
------------

- Continue removal of ``pserve`` daemon/process management features
  by deprecating ``--user`` and ``--group`` options.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2190

1.6b3 (2015-12-17)
==================

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- Remove the ``cachebust`` option from ``config.add_static_view``. See
  ``config.add_cache_buster`` for the new way to attach cache busters to
  static assets.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2186

- Modify the ``pyramid.interfaces.ICacheBuster`` API to be a simple callable
  instead of an object with ``match`` and ``pregenerate`` methods. Cache
  busters are now focused solely on generation. Matching has been dropped.

  Note this affects usage of ``pyramid.static.QueryStringCacheBuster`` and
  ``pyramid.static.ManifestCacheBuster``.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2186

Features
--------

- Add a new ``config.add_cache_buster`` API for attaching cache busters to
  static assets. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2186

Bug Fixes
---------

- Ensure that ``IAssetDescriptor.abspath`` always returns an absolute path.
  There were cases depending on the process CWD that a relative path would
  be returned. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2188

1.6b2 (2015-10-15)
==================

Features
--------

- Allow asset specifications to be supplied to
  ``pyramid.static.ManifestCacheBuster`` instead of requiring a
  filesystem path.

1.6b1 (2015-10-15)
==================

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- IPython and BPython support have been removed from pshell in the core.
  To continue using them on Pyramid 1.6+ you must install the binding
  packages explicitly::

    $ pip install pyramid_ipython

    or

    $ pip install pyramid_bpython

- Remove default cache busters introduced in 1.6a1 including
  ``PathSegmentCacheBuster``, ``PathSegmentMd5CacheBuster``, and
  ``QueryStringMd5CacheBuster``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2116

Features
--------

- Additional shells for ``pshell`` can now be registered as entrypoints. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1891 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2012

- The variables injected into ``pshell`` are now displayed with their
  docstrings instead of the default ``str(obj)`` when possible.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1929

- Add new ``pyramid.static.ManifestCacheBuster`` for use with external
  asset pipelines as well as examples of common usages in the narrative.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2116

- Fix ``pserve --reload`` to not crash on syntax errors!!!
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2125

- Fix an issue when user passes unparsed strings to ``pyramid.session.CookieSession``
  and ``pyramid.authentication.AuthTktCookieHelper`` for time related parameters
  ``timeout``, ``reissue_time``, ``max_age`` that expect an integer value.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2050

Bug Fixes
---------

- ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPException`` now defaults to
  ``520 Unknown Error`` instead of ``None None`` to conform with changes in
  WebOb 1.5.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1865

- ``pshell`` will now preserve the capitalization of variables in the
  ``[pshell]`` section of the INI file. This makes exposing classes to the
  shell a little more straightfoward.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1883

- Fixed usage of ``pserve --monitor-restart --daemon`` which would fail in
  horrible ways. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2118

- Explicitly prevent ``pserve --reload --daemon`` from being used. It's never
  been supported but would work and fail in weird ways.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2119

- Fix an issue on Windows when running ``pserve --reload`` in which the
  process failed to fork because it could not find the pserve script to
  run. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2138

Deprecations
------------

- Deprecate ``pserve --monitor-restart`` in favor of user's using a real
  process manager such as Systemd or Upstart as well as Python-based
  solutions like Circus and Supervisor.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2120

1.6a2 (2015-06-30)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Ensure that ``pyramid.httpexceptions.exception_response`` returns the
  appropriate "concrete" class for ``400`` and ``500`` status codes.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1832

- Fix an infinite recursion bug introduced in 1.6a1 when
  ``pyramid.view.render_view_to_response`` was called directly or indirectly.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1643

- Further fix the JSONP renderer by prefixing the returned content with
  a comment. This should mitigate attacks from Flash (See CVE-2014-4671).
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1649

- Allow periods and brackets (``[]``) in the JSONP callback. The original
  fix was overly-restrictive and broke Angular.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1649

1.6a1 (2015-04-15)
==================

Features
--------

- pcreate will now ask for confirmation if invoked with
  an argument for a project name that already exists or
  is importable in the current environment.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1357 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1837

- Make it possible to subclass ``pyramid.request.Request`` and also use
  ``pyramid.request.Request.add_request.method``.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1529

- The ``pyramid.config.Configurator`` has grown the ability to allow
  actions to call other actions during a commit-cycle. This enables much more
  logic to be placed into actions, such as the ability to invoke other actions
  or group them for improved conflict detection. We have also exposed and
  documented the config phases that Pyramid uses in order to further assist
  in building conforming addons.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1513

- Add ``pyramid.request.apply_request_extensions`` function which can be
  used in testing to apply any request extensions configured via
  ``config.add_request_method``. Previously it was only possible to test
  the extensions by going through Pyramid's router.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1581

- pcreate when run without a scaffold argument will now print information on
  the missing flag, as well as a list of available scaffolds.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1566 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1297

- Added support / testing for 'pypy3' under Tox and Travis.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1469

- Automate code coverage metrics across py2 and py3 instead of just py2.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1471

- Cache busting for static resources has been added and is available via a new
  argument to ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_static_view``: ``cachebust``.
  Core APIs are shipped for both cache busting via query strings and
  path segments and may be extended to fit into custom asset pipelines.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1380 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1583

- Add ``pyramid.config.Configurator.root_package`` attribute and init
  parameter to assist with includeable packages that wish to resolve
  resources relative to the package in which the ``Configurator`` was created.
  This is especially useful for addons that need to load asset specs from
  settings, in which case it is may be natural for a developer to define
  imports or assets relative to the top-level package.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1337

- Added line numbers to the log formatters in the scaffolds to assist with
  debugging. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1326

- Add new HTTP exception objects for status codes
  ``428 Precondition Required``, ``429 Too Many Requests`` and
  ``431 Request Header Fields Too Large`` in ``pyramid.httpexceptions``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1372/files

- The ``pshell`` script will now load a ``PYTHONSTARTUP`` file if one is
  defined in the environment prior to launching the interpreter.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1448

- Make it simple to define notfound and forbidden views that wish to use
  the default exception-response view but with altered predicates and other
  configuration options. The ``view`` argument is now optional in
  ``config.add_notfound_view`` and ``config.add_forbidden_view``..
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/494

- Greatly improve the readability of the ``pcreate`` shell script output.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1453

- Improve robustness to timing attacks in the ``AuthTktCookieHelper`` and
  the ``SignedCookieSessionFactory`` classes by using the stdlib's
  ``hmac.compare_digest`` if it is available (such as Python 2.7.7+ and 3.3+).
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1457

- Assets can now be overidden by an absolute path on the filesystem when using
  the ``config.override_asset`` API. This makes it possible to fully support
  serving up static content from a mutable directory while still being able
  to use the ``request.static_url`` API and ``config.add_static_view``.
  Previously it was not possible to use ``config.add_static_view`` with an
  absolute path **and** generate urls to the content. This change replaces
  the call, ``config.add_static_view('/abs/path', 'static')``, with
  ``config.add_static_view('myapp:static', 'static')`` and
  ``config.override_asset(to_override='myapp:static/',
  override_with='/abs/path/')``. The ``myapp:static`` asset spec is completely
  made up and does not need to exist - it is used for generating urls
  via ``request.static_url('myapp:static/foo.png')``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1252

- Added ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_response_factory`` and the
  ``response_factory`` keyword argument to the ``Configurator`` for defining
  a factory that will return a custom ``Response`` class.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1499

- Allow an iterator to be returned from a renderer. Previously it was only
  possible to return bytes or unicode.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1417

- ``pserve`` can now take a ``-b`` or ``--browser`` option to open the server
  URL in a web browser. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1533

- Overall improvments for the ``proutes`` command. Added ``--format`` and
  ``--glob`` arguments to the command, introduced the ``method``
  column for displaying available request methods, and improved the ``view``
  output by showing the module instead of just ``__repr__``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1488

- Support keyword-only arguments and function annotations in views in
  Python 3. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1556

- ``request.response`` will no longer be mutated when using the
  ``pyramid.renderers.render_to_response()`` API.  It is now necessary to
  pass in a ``response=`` argument to ``render_to_response`` if you wish to
  supply the renderer with a custom response object for it to use. If you
  do not pass one then a response object will be created using the
  application's ``IResponseFactory``. Almost all renderers
  mutate the ``request.response`` response object (for example, the JSON
  renderer sets ``request.response.content_type`` to ``application/json``).
  However, when invoking ``render_to_response`` it is not expected that the
  response object being returned would be the same one used later in the
  request. The response object returned from ``render_to_response`` is now
  explicitly different from ``request.response``. This does not change the
  API of a renderer. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1563

- The ``append_slash`` argument of ```Configurator().add_notfound_view()`` will
  now accept anything that implements the ``IResponse`` interface and will use
  that as the response class instead of the default ``HTTPFound``.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1610

Bug Fixes
---------

- The JSONP renderer created JavaScript code in such a way that a callback
  variable could be used to arbitrarily inject javascript into the response
  object. https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1627

- Work around an issue where ``pserve --reload`` would leave terminal echo
  disabled if it reloaded during a pdb session.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1577,
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1592

- ``pyramid.wsgi.wsgiapp`` and ``pyramid.wsgi.wsgiapp2`` now raise
  ``ValueError`` when accidentally passed ``None``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1320

- Fix an issue whereby predicates would be resolved as maybe_dotted in the
  introspectable but not when passed for registration. This would mean that
  ``add_route_predicate`` for example can not take a string and turn it into
  the actual callable function.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1306

- Fix ``pyramid.testing.setUp`` to return a ``Configurator`` with a proper
  package. Previously it was not possible to do package-relative includes
  using the returned ``Configurator`` during testing. There is now a
  ``package`` argument that can override this behavior as well.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1322

- Fix an issue where a ``pyramid.response.FileResponse`` may apply a charset
  where it does not belong. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1251

- Work around a bug introduced in Python 2.7.7 on Windows where
  ``mimetypes.guess_type`` returns Unicode rather than str for the content
  type, unlike any previous version of Python.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1360 for more information.

- ``pcreate`` now normalizes the package name by converting hyphens to
  underscores. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1376

- Fix an issue with the final response/finished callback being unable to
  add another callback to the list. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1373

- Fix a failing unittest caused by differing mimetypes across various OSs.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1405

- Fix route generation for static view asset specifications having no path.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1377

- Allow the ``pyramid.renderers.JSONP`` renderer to work even if there is no
  valid request object. In this case it will not wrap the object in a
  callback and thus behave just like the ``pyramid.renderers.JSON`` renderer.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1561

- Prevent "parameters to load are deprecated" ``DeprecationWarning``
  from setuptools>=11.3. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1541

- Avoiding sharing the ``IRenderer`` objects across threads when attached to
  a view using the `renderer=` argument. These renderers were instantiated
  at time of first render and shared between requests, causing potentially
  subtle effects like `pyramid.reload_templates = true` failing to work
  in `pyramid_mako`. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1575
  and https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1268

- Avoiding timing attacks against CSRF tokens.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1574

- ``request.finished_callbacks`` and ``request.response_callbacks`` now
  default to an iterable instead of ``None``. It may be checked for a length
  of 0. This was the behavior in 1.5.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``pserve`` command's daemonization features have been deprecated. This
  includes the ``[start,stop,restart,status]`` subcommands as well as the
  ``--daemon``, ``--stop-server``, ``--pid-file``, and ``--status`` flags.

  Please use a real process manager in the future instead of relying on the
  ``pserve`` to daemonize itself. Many options exist including your Operating
  System's services such as Systemd or Upstart, as well as Python-based
  solutions like Circus and Supervisor.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1641

- Renamed the ``principal`` argument to ``pyramid.security.remember()`` to
  ``userid`` in order to clarify its intended purpose.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1399

Docs
----

- Moved the documentation for ``accept`` on ``Configurator.add_view`` to no
  longer be part of the predicate list. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1391 for a bug report stating
  ``not_`` was failing on ``accept``. Discussion with @mcdonc led to the
  conclusion that it should not be documented as a predicate.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1487 for this PR

- Removed logging configuration from Quick Tutorial ini files except for
  scaffolding- and logging-related chapters to avoid needing to explain it too
  early.

- Clarify a previously-implied detail of the ``ISession.invalidate`` API
  documentation.

- Improve and clarify the documentation on what Pyramid defines as a
  ``principal`` and a ``userid`` in its security APIs.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1399

- Add documentation of command line programs (``p*`` scripts). See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2191

Scaffolds
---------

- Update scaffold generating machinery to return the version of pyramid and
  pyramid docs for use in scaffolds. Updated starter, alchemy and zodb
  templates to have links to correctly versioned documentation and reflect
  which pyramid was used to generate the scaffold.

- Removed non-ascii copyright symbol from templates, as this was
  causing the scaffolds to fail for project generation.

- You can now run the scaffolding func tests via ``tox py2-scaffolds`` and
  ``tox py3-scaffolds``.
