1.2a8 (2009-12-24)
==================

Features
--------

- Add a ``**kw`` arg to the ``Configurator.add_settings`` API.

- Add ``hook_zca`` and ``unhook_zca`` methods to the ``Configurator``
  API.

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` method now returns a
  ``Configurator`` instance which can be used to do further
  configuration during unit tests.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The ``json`` renderer failed to set the response content type to
  ``application/json``.  It now does, by setting
  ``request.response_content_type`` unless this attribute is already
  set.

- The ``string`` renderer failed to set the response content type to
  ``text/plain``.  It now does, by setting
  ``request.response_content_type`` unless this attribute is already
  set.

Documentation
-------------

- General documentation improvements by using better Sphinx roles such
  as "class", "func", "meth", and so on.  This means that there are
  many more hyperlinks pointing to API documentation for API
  definitions in all narrative, tutorial, and API documentation
  elements.

- Added a description of imperative configuration in various places
  which only described ZCML configuration.

- A syntactical refreshing of various tutorials.

- Added the ``repoze.bfg.authentication``,
  ``repoze.bfg.authorization``, and ``repoze.bfg.interfaces`` modules
  to API documentation.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerRoutesMapper`` API (added in an
  early 1.2 alpha) was deprecated.  Its import now generates a
  deprecation warning.

1.2a7 (2009-12-20)
==================

Features
--------

- Add four new testing-related APIs to the
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator`` class:
  ``testing_securitypolicy``, ``testing_models``,
  ``testing_add_subscriber``, and ``testing_add_template``.  These
  were added in order to provide more direct access to the
  functionality of the ``repoze.bfg.testing`` APIs named
  ``registerDummySecurityPolicy``, ``registerModels``,
  ``registerEventListener``, and ``registerTemplateRenderer`` when a
  configurator is used.  The ``testing`` APIs named are nominally
  deprecated (although they will likely remain around "forever", as
  they are in heavy use in the wild).

- Add a new API to the ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator``
  class: ``add_settings``.  This API can be used to add "settings"
  (information returned within via the
  ``repoze.bfg.settings.get_settings`` API) after the configurator has
  been initially set up.  This is most useful for testing purposes.

- Add a ``custom_predicates`` argument to the ``Configurator``
  ``add_view`` method, the ``bfg_view`` decorator and the attribute
  list of the ZCML ``view`` directive.  If ``custom_predicates`` is
  specified, it must be a sequence of predicate callables (a predicate
  callable accepts two arguments: ``context`` and ``request`` and
  returns ``True`` or ``False``).  The associated view callable will
  only be invoked if all custom predicates return ``True``.  Use one
  or more custom predicates when no existing predefined predicate is
  useful.  Predefined and custom predicates can be mixed freely.

- Add a ``custom_predicates`` argument to the ``Configurator``
  ``add_route`` and the attribute list of the ZCML ``route``
  directive.  If ``custom_predicates`` is specified, it must be a
  sequence of predicate callables (a predicate callable accepts two
  arguments: ``context`` and ``request`` and returns ``True`` or
  ``False``).  The associated route will match will only be invoked if
  all custom predicates return ``True``, else route matching
  continues.  Note that the value ``context`` will always be ``None``
  when passed to a custom route predicate.  Use one or more custom
  predicates when no existing predefined predicate is useful.
  Predefined and custom predicates can be mixed freely.

Internal
--------

- Remove the ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerTraverser`` function.  This
  function was never an API.

Documenation
------------

- Doc-deprecated most helper functions in the ``repoze.bfg.testing``
  module.  These helper functions likely won't be removed any time
  soon, nor will they generate a warning any time soon, due to their
  heavy use in the wild, but equivalent behavior exists in methods of
  a Configurator.

1.2a6 (2009-12-18)
==================

Features
--------

- The ``Configurator`` object now has two new methods: ``begin`` and
  ``end``.  The ``begin`` method is meant to be called before any
  "configuration" begins (e.g. before ``add_view``, et. al are
  called).  The ``end`` method is meant to be called after all
  "configuration" is complete.

  Previously, before there was imperative configuration at all (1.1
  and prior), configuration begin and end was invariably implied by
  the process of loading a ZCML file.  When a ZCML load happened, the
  threadlocal data structure containing the request and registry was
  modified before the load, and torn down after the load, making sure
  that all framework code that needed ``get_current_registry`` for the
  duration of the ZCML load was satisfied.

  Some API methods called during imperative configuration, (such as
  ``Configurator.add_view`` when a renderer is involved) end up for
  historical reasons calling ``get_current_registry``.  However, in
  1.2a5 and below, the Configurator supplied no functionality that
  allowed people to make sure that ``get_current_registry`` returned
  the registry implied by the configurator being used.  ``begin`` now
  serves this purpose.  Inversely, ``end`` pops the thread local
  stack, undoing the actions of ``begin``.

  We make this boundary explicit to reduce the potential for confusion
  when the configurator is used in different circumstances (e.g. in
  unit tests and app code vs. just in initial app setup).

  Existing code written for 1.2a1-1.2a5 which does not call ``begin``
  or ``end`` continues to work in the same manner it did before.  It
  is however suggested that this code be changed to call ``begin`` and
  ``end`` to reduce the potential for confusion in the future.

- All ``paster`` templates which generate an application skeleton now
  make use of the new ``begin`` and ``end`` methods of the
  Configurator they use in their respective copies of ``run.py`` and
  ``tests.py``.

Documentation
-------------

- All documentation that makes use of a ``Configurator`` object to do
  application setup and test setup now makes use of the new ``begin``
  and ``end`` methods of the configurator.

Bug Fixes
---------

- When a ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound`` or
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.Forbidden`` *class* (as opposed to instance)
  was raised as an exception within a root factory (or route root
  factory), the exception would not be caught properly by the
  ``repoze.bfg.`` Router and it would propagate to up the call stack,
  as opposed to rendering the not found view or the forbidden view as
  would have been expected.

- When Chameleon page or text templates used as renderers were added
  imperatively (via ``Configurator.add_view`` or some derivative),
  they too-eagerly attempted to look up the ``reload_templates``
  setting via ``get_settings``, meaning they were always registered in
  non-auto-reload-mode (the default).  Each now waits until its
  respective ``template`` attribute is accessed to look up the value.

- When a route with the same name as a previously registered route was
  added, the old route was not removed from the mapper's routelist.
  Symptom: the old registered route would be used (and possibly
  matched) during route lookup when it should not have had a chance to
  ever be used.

1.2a5 (2009-12-10)
==================

Features
--------

- When the ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound`` or
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.Forbidden`` error is raised from within a
  custom root factory or the ``factory`` of a route, the appropriate
  response is now sent to the requesting user agent (the result of the
  notfound view or the forbidden view, respectively).  When these
  errors are raised from within a root factory, the ``context`` passed
  to the notfound or forbidden view will be ``None``.  Also, the
  request will not be decorated with ``view_name``, ``subpath``,
  ``context``, etc. as would normally be the case if traversal had
  been allowed to take place.

Internals
---------

- The exception class representing the error raised by various methods
  of a ``Configurator`` is now importable as
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.ConfigurationError``.

Documentation
-------------

- General documentation freshening which takes imperative
  configuration into account in more places and uses glossary
  references more liberally.

- Remove explanation of changing the request type in a new request
  event subscriber, as other predicates are now usually an easier way
  to get this done.

- Added "Thread Locals" narrative chapter to documentation, and added
  a API chapter documenting the ``repoze.bfg.threadlocals`` module.

- Added a "Special Exceptions" section to the "Views" narrative
  documentation chapter explaining the effect of raising
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.Forbidden`` from within view code.

Dependencies
------------

- A new dependency on the ``twill`` package was added to the
  ``setup.py`` ``tests_require`` argument (Twill will only be
  downloaded when ``repoze.bfg`` ``setup.py test`` or ``setup.py
  nosetests`` is invoked).

1.2a4 (2009-12-07)
==================

Features
--------

- ``repoze.bfg.testing.DummyModel`` now accepts a new constructor
  keyword argument: ``__provides__``.  If this constructor argument is
  provided, it should be an interface or a tuple of interfaces.  The
  resulting model will then provide these interfaces (they will be
  attached to the constructed model via
  ``zope.interface.alsoProvides``).

Bug Fixes
---------

- Operation on GAE was broken, presumably because the
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration`` module began to attempt to import the
  ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_zpt`` and ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_text``
  modules, and these cannot be used on non-CPython platforms.  It now
  tolerates startup time import failures for these modules, and only
  raise an import error when a template from one of these packages is
  actually used.

1.2a3 (2009-12-02)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- The ``repoze.bfg.url.route_url`` function inappropriately passed
  along ``_query`` and/or ``_anchor`` arguments to the
  ``mapper.generate`` function, resulting in blowups.

- When two views were registered with differering ``for`` interfaces
  or classes, and the ``for`` of first view registered was a
  superclass of the second, the ``repoze.bfg`` view machinery would
  incorrectly associate the two views with the same "multiview".
  Multiviews are meant to be collections of views that have *exactly*
  the same for/request/viewname values, without taking inheritance
  into account.  Symptom: wrong view callable found even when you had
  correctly specified a ``for_`` interface/class during view
  configuration for one or both view configurations.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.templating`` module has been removed; it had been
  deprecated in 1.1 and never actually had any APIs in it.

1.2a2 (2009-11-29)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- The the long description of this package (as shown on PyPI) was not
  valid reStructuredText, and so was not renderable.

- Trying to use an HTTP method name string such as ``GET`` as a
  ``request_type`` predicate argument caused a startup time failure
  when it was encountered in imperative configuration or in a
  decorator (symptom: ``Type Error: Required specification must be a
  specification``).  This now works again, although ``request_method``
  is now the preferred predicate argument for associating a view
  configuration with an HTTP request method.

Documentation
-------------

- Fixed "Startup" narrative documentation chapter; it was explaining
  "the old way" an application constructor worked.

1.2a1 (2009-11-28)
==================

Features
--------

- An imperative configuration mode.

  A ``repoze.bfg`` application can now begin its life as a single
  Python file.  Later, the application might evolve into a set of
  Python files in a package.  Even later, it might start making use of
  other configuration features, such as ``ZCML``.  But neither the use
  of a package nor the use of non-imperative configuration is required
  to create a simple ``repoze.bfg`` application any longer.

  Imperative configuration makes ``repoze.bfg`` competetive with
  "microframeworks" such as `Bottle <http://bottle.paws.de/>`_ and
  `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_.  ``repoze.bfg`` has a good
  deal of functionality that most microframeworks lack, so this is
  hopefully a "best of both worlds" feature.

  The simplest possible ``repoze.bfg`` application is now::

     from webob import Response
     from wsgiref import simple_server
     from repoze.bfg.configuration import Configurator

     def hello_world(request):
         return Response('Hello world!')

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         config = Configurator()
         config.add_view(hello_world)
         app = config.make_wsgi_app()
         simple_server.make_server('', 8080, app).serve_forever()

- A new class now exists: ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator``.
  This class forms the basis for sharing machinery between
  "imperatively" configured applications and traditional
  declaratively-configured applications.

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` function now accepts three extra
  optional keyword arguments: ``registry``, ``request`` and
  ``hook_zca``.

  If the ``registry`` argument is not ``None``, the argument will be
  treated as the registry that is set as the "current registry" (it
  will be returned by ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry``)
  for the duration of the test.  If the ``registry`` argument is
  ``None`` (the default), a new registry is created and used for the
  duration of the test.

  The value of the ``request`` argument is used as the "current
  request" (it will be returned by
  ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_request``) for the duration of
  the test; it defaults to ``None``.

  If ``hook_zca`` is ``True`` (the default), the
  ``zope.component.getSiteManager`` function will be hooked with a
  function that returns the value of ``registry`` (or the
  default-created registry if ``registry`` is ``None``) instead of the
  registry returned by ``zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager``,
  causing the Zope Component Architecture API (``getSiteManager``,
  ``getAdapter``, ``getUtility``, and so on) to use the testing
  registry instead of the global ZCA registry.

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.tearDown`` function now accepts an
  ``unhook_zca`` argument.  If this argument is ``True`` (the
  default), ``zope.component.getSiteManager.reset()`` will be called.
  This will cause the result of the ``zope.component.getSiteManager``
  function to be the global ZCA registry (the result of
  ``zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager``) once again.

- The ``run.py`` module in various ``repoze.bfg`` ``paster`` templates
  now use a ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator`` class instead of
  the (now-legacy) ``repoze.bfg.router.make_app`` function to produce
  a WSGI application.

Documentation
-------------

- The documentation now uses the "request-only" view calling
  convention in most examples (as opposed to the ``context, request``
  convention).  This is a documentation-only change; the ``context,
  request`` convention is also supported and documented, and will be
  "forever".

- ``repoze.bfg.configuration`` API documentation has been added.

- A narrative documentation chapter entitled "Creating Your First
  ``repoze.bfg`` Application" has been added.  This chapter details
  usage of the new ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator`` class,
  and demonstrates a simplified "imperative-mode" configuration; doing
  ``repoze.bfg`` application configuration imperatively was previously
  much more difficult.

- A narrative documentation chapter entitled "Configuration,
  Decorations and Code Scanning" explaining ZCML- vs. imperative-
  vs. decorator-based configuration equivalence.

- The "ZCML Hooks" chapter has been renamed to "Hooks"; it documents
  how to override hooks now via imperative configuration and ZCML.

- The explanation about how to supply an alternate "response factory"
  has been removed from the "Hooks" chapter.  This feature may be
  removed in a later release (it still works now, it's just not
  documented).

- Add a section entitled "Test Set Up and Tear Down" to the
  unittesting chapter.

Bug Fixes
----------

- The ACL authorization policy debugging output when
  ``debug_authorization`` console debugging output was turned on
  wasn't as clear as it could have been when a view execution was
  denied due to an authorization failure resulting from the set of
  principals passed never having matched any ACE in any ACL in the
  lineage.  Now in this case, we report ``<default deny>`` as the ACE
  value and either the root ACL or ``<No ACL found on any object in
  model lineage>`` if no ACL was found.

- When two views were registered with the same ``accept`` argument,
  but were otherwise registered with the same arguments, if a request
  entered the application which had an ``Accept`` header that accepted
  *either* of the media types defined by the set of views registered
  with predicates that otherwise matched, a more or less "random" one
  view would "win".  Now, we try harder to use the view callable
  associated with the view configuration that has the most specific
  ``accept`` argument.  Thanks to Alberto Valverde for an initial
  patch.

Internals
---------

- The routes mapper is no longer a root factory wrapper.  It is now
  consulted directly by the router.

- The ``repoze.bfg.registry.make_registry`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.map_view`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.owrap_view`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.predicate_wrap`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.secure_view`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.authdebug_view`` callable has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.renderer_from_name`` callable has been
  removed.  Use ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.renderer_from_name``
  instead (still not an API, however).

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.derive_view`` callable has been removed.  Use
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.derive_view`` instead (still
  not an API, however).

- The ``repoze.bfg.settings.get_options`` callable has been removed.
  Its job has been subsumed by the ``repoze.bfg.settings.Settings``
  class constructor.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.requestonly`` function has been moved to
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.requestonly``.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.rendered_response`` function has been moved to
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.rendered_response``.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.decorate_view`` function has been moved to
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.decorate_view``.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.MultiView`` class has been moved to
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.MultiView``.

- The ``repoze.bfg.zcml.Uncacheable`` class has been removed.

- The ``repoze.bfg.resource.resource_spec`` function has been removed.

- All ZCML directives which deal with attributes which are paths now
  use the ``path`` method of the ZCML context to resolve a relative
  name to an absolute one (imperative configuration requirement).

- The ``repoze.bfg.scripting.get_root`` API now uses a 'real' WebOb
  request rather than a FakeRequest when it sets up the request as a
  threadlocal.

- The ``repoze.bfg.traversal.traverse`` API now uses a 'real' WebOb
  request rather than a FakeRequest when it calls the traverser.

- The ``repoze.bfg.request.FakeRequest`` class has been removed.

- Most uses of the ZCA threadlocal API (the ``getSiteManager``,
  ``getUtility``, ``getAdapter``, ``getMultiAdapter`` threadlocal API)
  have been removed from the core.  Instead, when a threadlocal is
  necessary, the core uses the
  ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry`` API to obtain the
  registry.

- The internal ILogger utility named ``repoze.bfg.debug`` is now just
  an IDebugLogger unnamed utility.  A named utility with the old name
  is registered for b/w compat.

- The ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.ITemplateRendererFactory`` interface was
  removed; it has become unused.

- Instead of depending on the ``martian`` package to do code scanning,
  we now just use our own scanning routines.

- We now no longer have a dependency on ``repoze.zcml`` package;
  instead, the ``repoze.bfg`` package includes implementations of the
  ``adapter``, ``subscriber`` and ``utility`` directives.

- Relating to the following functions:

  ``repoze.bfg.view.render_view``

  ``repoze.bfg.view.render_view_to_iterable``

  ``repoze.bfg.view.render_view_to_response``

  ``repoze.bfg.view.append_slash_notfound_view``

  ``repoze.bfg.view.default_notfound_view``

  ``repoze.bfg.view.default_forbidden_view``

  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.rendered_response``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.has_permission``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.authenticated_userid``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.effective_principals``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.view_execution_permitted``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.remember``

  ``repoze.bfg.security.forget``

  ``repoze.bfg.url.route_url``

  ``repoze.bfg.url.model_url``

  ``repoze.bfg.url.static_url``

  ``repoze.bfg.traversal.virtual_root``

  Each of these functions now expects to be called with a request
  object that has a ``registry`` attribute which represents the
  current ``repoze.bfg`` registry.  They fall back to obtaining the
  registry from the threadlocal API.

Backwards Incompatibilites
--------------------------

- Unit tests which use ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` for the
  purpose of isolating tests from one another may now begin to fail
  due to lack of isolation between tests.

  Here's why: In repoze.bfg 1.1 and prior, the registry returned by
  ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry`` when no other
  registry had been pushed on to the threadlocal stack was the
  ``zope.component.globalregistry.base`` global registry (aka the
  result of ``zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager()``).  In repoze.bfg
  1.2+, however, the registry returned in this situation is the new
  module-scope ``repoze.bfg.registry.global_registry`` object.  The
  ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` function clears the
  ``zope.component.globalregistry.base`` global registry
  unconditionally.  However, it does not know about the
  ``repoze.bfg.registry.global_registry`` object, so it does not clear
  it.

  If you use the ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` function in the
  ``setUp`` of test cases in your unit test suite instead of using the
  (more correct as of 1.1) ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp``, you will need
  to replace all calls to ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` with a call
  to ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp``.

  If replacing all calls to ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` with a
  call to ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` is infeasible, you can put this
  bit of code somewhere that is executed exactly **once** (*not* for
  each test in a test suite; in the `` __init__.py`` of your package
  or your package's ``tests`` subpackage would be a reasonable
  place)::

    import zope.testing.cleanup
    from repoze.bfg.testing import setUp
    zope.testing.cleanup.addCleanUp(setUp)

- When there is no "current registry" in the
  ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.manager`` threadlocal data structure (this
  is the case when there is no "current request" or we're not in the
  midst of a ``r.b.testing.setUp``-bounded unit test), the ``.get``
  method of the manager returns a data structure containing a *global*
  registry.  In previous releases, this function returned the global
  Zope "base" registry: the result of
  ``zope.component.getGlobalSiteManager``, which is an instance of the
  ``zope.component.registry.Component`` class.  In this release,
  however, the global registry returns a globally importable instance
  of the ``repoze.bfg.registry.Registry`` class.  This registry
  instance can always be imported as
  ``repoze.bfg.registry.global_registry``.

  Effectively, this means that when you call
  ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry`` when no request or
  ``setUp`` bounded unit test is in effect, you will always get back
  the global registry that lives in
  ``repoze.bfg.registry.global_registry``.  It also means that
  ``repoze.bfg`` APIs that *call* ``get_current_registry`` will use
  this registry.

  This change was made because ``repoze.bfg`` now expects the registry
  it uses to have a slightly different API than a bare instance of
  ``zope.component.registry.Components``.

- View registration no longer registers a
  ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.IViewPermission`` adapter (it is no longer
  checked by the framework; since 1.1, views have been responsible for
  providing their own security).

- The ``repoze.bfg.router.make_app`` callable no longer accepts the
  ``authentication_policy`` nor the ``authorization_policy``
  arguments.  This feature was deprecated in version 1.0 and has been
  removed.

- Obscure: the machinery which configured views with a
  ``request_type`` *and* a ``route_name`` would ignore the request
  interface implied by ``route_name`` registering a view only for the
  interface implied by ``request_type``.  In the unlikely event that
  you were trying to use these two features together, the symptom
  would have been that views that named a ``request_type`` but which
  were also associated with routes were not found when the route
  matched.  Now if a view is configured with both a ``request_type``
  and a ``route_name``, an error is raised.

- The ``route`` ZCML directive now no longer accepts the
  ``request_type`` or ``view_request_type`` attributes.  These
  attributes didn't actually work in any useful way (see entry above
  this one).

- Because the ``repoze.bfg`` package now includes implementations of
  the ``adapter``, ``subscriber`` and ``utility`` ZCML directives, it
  is now an error to have ``<include package="repoze.zcml"
  file="meta.zcml"/>`` in the ZCML of a ``repoze.bfg`` application.  A
  ZCML conflict error will be raised if your ZCML does so.  This
  shouldn't be an issue for "normal" installations; it has always been
  the responsibility of the ``repoze.bfg.includes`` ZCML to include
  this file in the past; it now just doesn't.

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.zcml_configure`` API was removed.  Use
  the ``Configurator.load_zcml`` API instead.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.router.make_app`` function is now nominally
  deprecated.  Its import and usage does not throw a warning, nor will
  it probably ever disappear.  However, using a
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator`` class is now the preferred
  way to generate a WSGI application.

  Note that ``make_app`` calls
  ``zope.component.getSiteManager.sethook(
  repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry)`` on the caller's
  behalf, hooking ZCA global API lookups, for backwards compatibility
  purposes.  If you disuse ``make_app``, your calling code will need
  to perform this call itself, at least if your application uses the
  ZCA global API (``getSiteManager``, ``getAdapter``, etc).

Dependencies
------------

- A dependency on the ``martian`` package has been removed (its
  functionality is replaced internally).

- A dependency on the ``repoze.zcml`` package has been removed (its
  functionality is replaced internally).
