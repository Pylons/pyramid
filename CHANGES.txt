Next release
============

Features
--------

- The ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.add_route`` API now
  returns the route object that was added.

- A ``repoze.bfg.events.subscriber`` decorator was added.  This
  decorator decorates module-scope functions, which are then treated
  as event listeners after a scan() is performed.  See the Events
  narrative documentation chapter and the ``repoze.bfg.events`` module
  documentation for more information.

Bug Fixes
---------

- When adding a view for a route which did not yet exist ("did not yet
  exist" meaning, temporally, a view was added with a route name for a
  route which had not yet been added via add_route), the value of the
  ``custom_predicate`` argument to ``add_view`` was lost.  Symptom:
  wrong view matches when using URL dispatch and custom view
  predicates together.

Documentation
--------------

- Added description of the ``repoze.bfg.events.subscriber`` decorator
  to the Events narrative chapter.

- Added ``repoze.bfg.events.subscriber`` API documentation to
  ``repoze.bfg.events`` API docs.

- Added a section named "Zope 3 Enforces 'TTW' Authorization Checks By
  Default; BFG Does Not" to the "Design Defense" chapter.

1.3a6 (2010-07-25)
==================

Features
--------

- New argument to ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.add_route``
  and the ``route`` ZCML directive: ``traverse``.  If you would like
  to cause the ``context`` to be something other than the ``root``
  object when this route matches, you can spell a traversal pattern as
  the ``traverse`` argument.  This traversal pattern will be used as
  the traversal path: traversal will begin at the root object implied
  by this route (either the global root, or the object returned by the
  ``factory`` associated with this route).

  The syntax of the ``traverse`` argument is the same as it is for
  ``path``. For example, if the ``path`` provided is
  ``articles/:article/edit``, and the ``traverse`` argument provided
  is ``/:article``, when a request comes in that causes the route to
  match in such a way that the ``article`` match value is '1' (when
  the request URI is ``/articles/1/edit``), the traversal path will be
  generated as ``/1``.  This means that the root object's
  ``__getitem__`` will be called with the name ``1`` during the
  traversal phase.  If the ``1`` object exists, it will become the
  ``context`` of the request.  The Traversal narrative has more
  information about traversal.

  If the traversal path contains segment marker names which are not
  present in the path argument, a runtime error will occur.  The
  ``traverse`` pattern should not contain segment markers that do not
  exist in the ``path``.

  A similar combining of routing and traversal is available when a
  route is matched which contains a ``*traverse`` remainder marker in
  its path.  The ``traverse`` argument allows you to associate route
  patterns with an arbitrary traversal path without using a a
  ``*traverse`` remainder marker; instead you can use other match
  information.

  Note that the ``traverse`` argument is ignored when attached to a
  route that has a ``*traverse`` remainder marker in its path.

- A new method of the ``Configurator`` exists:
  ``set_request_factory``.  If used, this method will set the factory
  used by the ``repoze.bfg`` router to create all request objects.

- The ``Configurator`` constructor takes an additional argument:
  ``request_factory``.  If used, this argument will set the factory
  used by the ``repoze.bfg`` router to create all request objects.

- The ``Configurator`` constructor takes an additional argument:
  ``request_factory``.  If used, this argument will set the factory
  used by the ``repoze.bfg`` router to create all request objects.

- A new method of the ``Configurator`` exists:
  ``set_renderer_globals_factory``.  If used, this method will set the
  factory used by the ``repoze.bfg`` router to create renderer
  globals.

- A new method of the ``Configurator`` exists: ``get_settings``.  If
  used, this method will return the current settings object (performs
  the same job as the ``repoze.bfg.settings.get_settings`` API).

- The ``Configurator`` constructor takes an additional argument:
  ``renderer_globals_factory``.  If used, this argument will set the
  factory used by the ``repoze.bfg`` router to create renderer
  globals.

- Add ``repoze.bfg.renderers.render``,
  ``repoze.bfg.renderers.render_to_response`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.renderers.get_renderer`` functions.  These are
  imperative APIs which will use the same rendering machinery used by
  view configurations with a ``renderer=`` attribute/argument to
  produce a rendering or renderer.  Because these APIs provide a
  central API for all rendering, they now form the preferred way to
  perform imperative template rendering.  Using functions named
  ``render_*`` from modules such as ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_zpt`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_text`` is now discouraged (although not
  deprecated).  The code the backing older templating-system-specific
  APIs now calls into the newer ``repoze.bfg.renderer`` code.

- The ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.testing_add_template``
  has been renamed to ``testing_add_renderer``.  A backwards
  compatibility alias is present using the old name.

Documentation
-------------

- The ``Hybrid`` narrative chapter now contains a description of the
  ``traverse`` route argument.

- The ``Hooks`` narrative chapter now contains sections about
  changing the request factory and adding a renderer globals factory.

- The API documentation includes a new module:
  ``repoze.bfg.renderers``.

- The ``Templates`` chapter was updated; all narrative that used
  templating-specific APIs within examples to perform rendering (such
  as the ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_zpt.render_template_to_response``
  method) was changed to use ``repoze.bfg.renderers.render_*``
  functions.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The ``header`` predicate (when used as either a view predicate or a
  route predicate) had a problem when specified with a name/regex
  pair.  When the header did not exist in the headers dictionary, the
  regex match could be fed ``None``, causing it to throw a
  ``TypeError: expected string or buffer`` exception.  Now, the
  predicate returns False as intended.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.renderers.rendered_response`` function was never an
  official API, but may have been imported by extensions in the wild.
  It is officially deprecated in this release.  Use
  ``repoze.bfg.renderers.render_to_response`` instead.

- The following APIs are *documentation* deprecated (meaning they are
  officially deprecated in documentation but do not raise a
  deprecation error upon their usage, and may continue to work for an
  indefinite period of time):

  In the ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_zpt`` module: ``get_renderer``,
  ``get_template``, ``render_template``,
  ``render_template_to_response``.  The suggested alternatives are
  documented within the docstrings of those methods (which are still
  present in the documentation).

  In the ``repoze.bfg.chameleon_text`` module: ``get_renderer``,
  ``get_template``, ``render_template``,
  ``render_template_to_response``.  The suggested alternatives are
  documented within the docstrings of those methods (which are still
  present in the documentation).

  In general, to perform template-related functions, one should now
  use the various methods in the ``repoze.bfg.renderers`` module.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- A new internal exception class (*not* an API) named
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.PredicateMismatch`` now exists.  This
  exception is currently raised when no constituent view of a
  multiview can be called (due to no predicate match).  Previously, in
  this situation, a ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound`` was raised.  We
  provide backwards compatibility for code that expected a
  ``NotFound`` to be raised when no predicates match by causing
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.PredicateMismatch`` to inherit from
  ``NotFound``.  This will cause any exception view registered for
  ``NotFound`` to be called when a predicate mismatch occurs, as was
  the previous behavior.

  There is however, one perverse case that will expose a backwards
  incompatibility.  If 1) you had a view that was registered as a
  member of a multiview 2) this view explicitly raised a ``NotFound``
  exception *in order to* proceed to the next predicate check in the
  multiview, that code will now behave differently: rather than
  skipping to the next view match, a NotFound will be raised to the
  top-level exception handling machinery instead.  For code to be
  depending upon the behavior of a view raising ``NotFound`` to
  proceed to the next predicate match, would be tragic, but not
  impossible, given that ``NotFound`` is a public interface.
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.PredicateMismatch`` is not a public API and
  cannot be depended upon by application code, so you should not
  change your view code to raise ``PredicateMismatch``.  Instead, move
  the logic which raised the ``NotFound`` exception in the view out
  into a custom view predicate.

- If, when you run your application's unit test suite under BFG 1.3, a
  ``KeyError`` naming a template or a ``ValueError`` indicating that a
  'renderer factory' is not registered may is raised
  (e.g. ``ValueError: No factory for renderer named '.pt' when looking
  up karl.views:templates/snippets.pt``), you may need to perform some
  extra setup in your test code.

  The best solution is to use the
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.testing_add_renderer`` (or,
  alternately the deprecated
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerTemplateRenderer`` or
  ``registerDummyRenderer``) API within the code comprising each
  individual unit test suite to register a "dummy" renderer for each
  of the templates and renderers used by code under test.  For
  example::

    config = Configurator()
    config.testing_add_renderer('karl.views:templates/snippets.pt')

  This will register a basic dummy renderer for this particular
  missing template.  The ``testing_add_renderer`` API actually
  *returns* the renderer, but if you don't care about how the render
  is used, you don't care about having a reference to it either.

  A more rough way to solve the issue exists.  It causes the "real"
  template implementations to be used while the system is under test,
  which is suboptimal, because tests will run slower, and unit tests
  won't actually *be* unit tests, but it is easier.  Always ensure you
  call the ``setup_registry()`` method of the Configurator .  Eg::

    reg = MyRegistry()
    config = Configurator(registry=reg)
    config.setup_registry()

  Calling ``setup_registry`` only has an effect if you're *passing in*
  a ``registry`` argument to the Configurator constructor.
  ``setup_registry`` is called by the course of normal operations
  anyway if you do not pass in a ``registry``.

  If your test suite isn't using a Configurator yet, and is still
  using the older ``repoze.bfg.testing`` APIs name ``setUp`` or
  ``cleanUp``, these will register the renderers on your behalf.

  A variant on the symptom for this theme exists: you may already be
  dutifully registering a dummy template or renderer for a template
  used by the code you're testing using ``testing_register_renderer``
  or ``registerTemplateRenderer``, but (perhaps unbeknownst to you)
  the code under test expects to be able to use a "real" template
  renderer implementation to retrieve or render *another* template
  that you forgot was being rendered as a side effect of calling the
  code you're testing.  This happened to work because it found the
  *real* template while the system was under test previously, and now
  it cannot.  The solution is the same.

  It may also help reduce confusion to use a *resource specification*
  to specify the template path in the test suite and code rather than
  a relative path in either.  A resource specification is unambiguous,
  while a relative path needs to be relative to "here", where "here"
  isn't always well-defined ("here" in a test suite may or may not be
  the same as "here" in the code under test).

1.3a5 (2010-07-14)
==================

Features
--------

- New internal exception: ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.URLDecodeError``.
  This URL is a subclass of the built-in Python exception named
  ``UnicodeDecodeError``.

- When decoding a URL segment to Unicode fails, the exception raised
  is now ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.URLDecodeError`` instead of
  ``UnicodeDecodeError``.  This makes it possible to register an
  exception view invoked specifically when ``repoze.bfg`` cannot
  decode a URL.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix regression in
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.add_static_view``.  Before
  1.3a4, view names that contained a slash were supported as route
  prefixes. 1.3a4 broke this by trying to treat them as full URLs.

Documentation
-------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.URLDecodeError`` exception was added to
  the exceptions chapter of the API documentation.

Backwards Incompatibilities
----------------------------

- in previous releases, when a URL could not be decoded from UTF-8
  during traversal, a ``TypeError`` was raised.  Now the error which
  is raised is a ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.URLDecodeError``.

1.3a4 (2010-07-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Undocumented hook: make ``get_app`` and ``get_root`` of the
  ``repoze.bfg.paster.BFGShellCommand`` hookable in cases where
  endware may interfere with the default versions.

- In earlier versions, a custom route predicate associated with a url
  dispatch route (each of the predicate functions fed to the
  ``custom_predicates`` argument of
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.add_route``) has always
  required a 2-positional argument signature, e.g. ``(context,
  request)``.  Before this release, the ``context`` argument was
  always ``None``.

  As of this release, the first argument passed to a predicate is now
  a dictionary conventionally named ``info`` consisting of ``route``,
  and ``match``.  ``match`` is a dictionary: it represents the
  arguments matched in the URL by the route.  ``route`` is an object
  representing the route which was matched.

  This is useful when predicates need access to the route match.  For
  example::

    def any_of(segment_name, *args):
        def predicate(info, request):
            if info['match'][segment_name] in args:
                return True
        return predicate

    num_one_two_or_three = any_of('num, 'one', 'two', 'three')

    add_route('num', '/:num', custom_predicates=(num_one_two_or_three,))

  The ``route`` object is an object that has two useful attributes:
  ``name`` and ``path``.  The ``name`` attribute is the route name.
  The ``path`` attribute is the route pattern.  An example of using
  the route in a set of route predicates::

    def twenty_ten(info, request):
        if info['route'].name in ('ymd', 'ym', 'y'):
            return info['match']['year'] == '2010'

    add_route('y', '/:year', custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))
    add_route('ym', '/:year/:month', custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))
    add_route('ymd', '/:year/:month:/day', custom_predicates=(twenty_ten,))

- The ``repoze.bfg.url.route_url`` API has changed.  If a keyword
  ``_app_url`` is present in the arguments passed to ``route_url``,
  this value will be used as the protocol/hostname/port/leading path
  prefix of the generated URL.  For example, using an ``_app_url`` of
  ``http://example.com:8080/foo`` would cause the URL
  ``http://example.com:8080/foo/fleeb/flub`` to be returned from this
  function if the expansion of the route pattern associated with the
  ``route_name`` expanded to ``/fleeb/flub``.

- It is now possible to use a URL as the ``name`` argument fed to
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator.add_static_view``.  When the
  name argument is a URL, the ``repoze.bfg.url.static_url`` API will
  generate join this URL (as a prefix) to a path including the static
  file name.  This makes it more possible to put static media on a
  separate webserver for production, while keeping static media
  package-internal and served by the development webserver during
  development.

Documentation
-------------

- The authorization chapter of the ZODB Wiki Tutorial
  (docs/tutorials/bfgwiki) was changed to demonstrate authorization
  via a group rather than via a direct username (thanks to Alex
  Marandon).

- The authorization chapter of the SQLAlchemy Wiki Tutorial
  (docs/tutorials/bfgwiki2) was changed to demonstrate authorization
  via a group rather than via a direct username.

- Redirect requests for tutorial sources to
  http://docs.repoze.org/bfgwiki-1.3 and
  http://docs.repoze.org/bfgwiki2-1.3/ respectively.

- A section named ``Custom Route Predicates`` was added to the URL
  Dispatch narrative chapter.

- The Static Resources chapter has been updated to mention using
  ``static_url`` to generate URLs to external webservers.

Internal
--------

- Removed ``repoze.bfg.static.StaticURLFactory`` in favor of a new
  abstraction revolving around the (still-internal)
  ``repoze.bfg.static.StaticURLInfo`` helper class.

1.3a3 (2010-05-01)
==================

Paster Templates
----------------

- The ``bfg_alchemy`` and ``bfg_routesalchemy`` templates no longer
  register a ``handle_teardown`` event listener which calls
  ``DBSession.remove``.  This was found by Chris Withers to be
  unnecessary.

Documentation
-------------

- The "bfgwiki2" (URL dispatch wiki) tutorial code and documentation
  was changed to remove the ``handle_teardown`` event listener which
  calls ``DBSession.remove``.

- Any mention of the ``handle_teardown`` event listener as used by the
  paster templates was removed from the URL Dispatch narrative chapter.

- A section entitled Detecting Available Languages was added to the
  i18n narrative docs chapter.

1.3a2 (2010-04-28)
==================

Features
--------

- A locale negotiator no longer needs to be registered explicitly. The
  default locale negotiator at
  ``repoze.bfg.i18n.default_locale_negotiator`` is now used
  unconditionally as... um, the default locale negotiator.

- The default locale negotiator has become more complex.

  * First, the negotiator looks for the ``_LOCALE_`` attribute of
    the request object (possibly set by a view or an event listener).
  
  * Then it looks for the ``request.params['_LOCALE_']`` value.

  * Then it looks for the ``request.cookies['_LOCALE_']`` value.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The default locale negotiator now looks for the parameter named
  ``_LOCALE_`` rather than a parameter named ``locale`` in
  ``request.params``.

Behavior Changes
----------------

- A locale negotiator may now return ``None``, signifying that the
  default locale should be used.

Documentation
-------------

- Documentation concerning locale negotiation in the
  Internationalizationa and Localization chapter was updated.

- Expanded portion of i18n narrative chapter docs which discuss
  working with gettext files.

1.3a1 (2010-04-26)
==================

Features
--------

- Added "exception views".  When you use an exception (anything that
  inherits from the Python ``Exception`` builtin) as view context
  argument, e.g.::

      from repoze.bfg.view import bfg_view
      from repoze.bfg.exceptions import NotFound
      from webob.exc import HTTPNotFound

      @bfg_view(context=NotFound)
      def notfound_view(request):
          return HTTPNotFound()

  For the above example, when the ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound``
  exception is raised by any view or any root factory, the
  ``notfound_view`` view callable will be invoked and its response
  returned.

  Other normal view predicates can also be used in combination with an
  exception view registration::

      from repoze.bfg.view import bfg_view
      from repoze.bfg.exceptions import NotFound
      from webob.exc import HTTPNotFound

      @bfg_view(context=NotFound, route_name='home')
      def notfound_view(request):
          return HTTPNotFound()

  The above exception view names the ``route_name`` of ``home``,
  meaning that it will only be called when the route matched has a
  name of ``home``.  You can therefore have more than one exception
  view for any given exception in the system: the "most specific" one
  will be called when the set of request circumstances which match the
  view registration.  The only predicate that cannot be not be used
  successfully is ``name``.  The name used to look up an exception
  view is always the empty string.

  Existing (pre-1.3) normal views registered against objects
  inheriting from ``Exception`` will continue to work.  Exception
  views used for user-defined exceptions and system exceptions used as
  contexts will also work.

  The feature can be used with any view registration mechanism
  (``@bfg_view`` decorator, ZCML, or imperative ``config.add_view``
  styles).

  This feature was kindly contributed by Andrey Popp.

- Use "Venusian" (`http://docs.repoze.org/venusian
  <http://docs.repoze.org/venusian>`_) to perform ``bfg_view``
  decorator scanning rather than relying on a BFG-internal decorator
  scanner.  (Truth be told, Venusian is really just a generalization
  of the BFG-internal decorator scanner).

- Internationalization and localization features as documented in the
  narrative documentation chapter entitled ``Internationalization and
  Localization``.

- A new deployment setting named ``default_locale_name`` was added.
  If this string is present as a Paster ``.ini`` file option, it will
  be considered the default locale name.  The default locale name is
  used during locale-related operations such as language translation.

- It is now possible to turn on Chameleon template "debugging mode"
  for all Chameleon BFG templates by setting a BFG-related Paster
  ``.ini`` file setting named ``debug_templates``. The exceptions
  raised by Chameleon templates when a rendering fails are sometimes
  less than helpful.  ``debug_templates`` allows you to configure your
  application development environment so that exceptions generated by
  Chameleon during template compilation and execution will contain
  more helpful debugging information.  This mode is on by default in
  all new projects.

- Add a new method of the Configurator named ``derive_view`` which can
  be used to generate a BFG view callable from a user-supplied
  function, instance, or class. This useful for external framework and
  plugin authors wishing to wrap callables supplied by their users
  which follow the same calling conventions and response conventions
  as objects that can be supplied directly to BFG as a view callable.
  See the ``derive_view`` method in the
  ``repoze.bfg.configuration.Configurator`` docs.

ZCML
----

- Add a ``translationdir`` ZCML directive to support localization.

- Add a ``localenegotiator`` ZCML directive to support localization.

Deprecations
------------

-  The exception views feature replaces the need for the
   ``set_notfound_view`` and ``set_forbidden_view`` methods of the
   ``Configurator`` as well as the ``notfound`` and ``forbidden`` ZCML
   directives.  Those methods and directives will continue to work for
   the foreseeable future, but they are deprecated in the
   documentation.

Dependencies
------------

- A new install-time dependency on the ``venusian`` distribution was
  added.

- A new install-time dependency on the ``translationstring``
  distribution was added.

- Chameleon 1.2.3 or better is now required (internationalization and
  per-template debug settings).

Internal
--------

- View registrations and lookups are now done with three "requires"
  arguments instead of two to accomodate orthogonality of exception
  views.

- The ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.IForbiddenView`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.interfaces.INotFoundView`` interfaces were removed;
  they weren't APIs and they became vestigial with the addition of
  exception views.

- Remove ``repoze.bfg.compat.pkgutil_26.py`` and import alias
  ``repoze.bfg.compat.walk_packages``.  These were only required by
  internal scanning machinery; Venusian replaced the internal scanning
  machinery, so these are no longer required.

Documentation
-------------

- Exception view documentation was added to the ``Hooks`` narrative
  chapter.

- A new narrative chapter entitled ``Internationalization and
  Localization`` was added.

- The "Environment Variables and ``ini`` File Settings" chapter was
  changed: documentation about the ``default_locale_name`` setting was
  added.

- A new API chapter for the ``repoze.bfg.i18n`` module was added.

- Documentation for the new ``translationdir`` and
  ``localenegotiator`` ZCML directives were added.

- A section was added to the Templates chapter entitled "Nicer
  Exceptions in Templates" describing the result of setting
  ``debug_templates = true``.

Paster Templates
----------------

- All paster templates now create a ``setup.cfg`` which includes
  commands related to nose testing and Babel message catalog
  extraction/compilation.

- A ``default_locale_name = en`` setting was added to each existing paster
  template.

- A ``debug_templates = true`` setting was added to each existing
  paster template.

Licensing
---------

- The Edgewall (BSD) license was added to the LICENSES.txt file, as
  some code in the ``repoze.bfg.i18n`` derives from Babel source.
