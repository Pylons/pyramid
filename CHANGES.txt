1.3b1 (2012-02-26)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- ``pyramid.config.Configurator.with_package`` didn't work if the
  Configurator was an old-style ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator``
  instance.

- Pyramid authorization policies did not show up in the introspector.

Deprecations
------------

- All references to the ``tmpl_context`` request variable were removed from
  the docs.  Its existence in Pyramid is confusing for people who were never
  Pylons users.  It was added as a porting convenience for Pylons users in
  Pyramid 1.0, but it never caught on because the Pyramid rendering system is
  a lot different than Pylons' was, and alternate ways exist to do what it
  was designed to offer in Pylons.  It will continue to exist "forever" but
  it will not be recommended or mentioned in the docs.

1.3a9 (2012-02-22)
==================

Features
--------

- Add an ``introspection`` boolean to the Configurator constructor.  If this
  is ``True``, actions registered using the Configurator will be registered
  with the introspector.  If it is ``False``, they won't.  The default is
  ``True``.  Setting it to ``False`` during action processing will prevent
  introspection for any following registration statements, and setting it to
  ``True`` will start them up again.  This addition is to service a
  requirement that the debug toolbar's own views and methods not show up in
  the introspector.

- New API: ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_notfound_view``.  This is a
  wrapper for ``pyramid.Config.configurator.add_view`` which provides easy
  append_slash support and does the right thing about permissions.  It should
  be preferred over calling ``add_view`` directly with
  ``context=HTTPNotFound`` as was previously recommended.

- New API: ``pyramid.view.notfound_view_config``.  This is a decorator
  constructor like ``pyramid.view.view_config`` that calls
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_notfound_view`` when scanned.  It should
  be preferred over using ``pyramid.view.view_config`` with
  ``context=HTTPNotFound`` as was previously recommended.

- New API: ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_forbidden_view``.  This is a
  wrapper for ``pyramid.Config.configurator.add_view`` which does the right
  thing about permissions.  It should be preferred over calling ``add_view``
  directly with ``context=HTTPForbidden`` as was previously recommended.

- New API: ``pyramid.view.forbidden_view_config``.  This is a decorator
  constructor like ``pyramid.view.view_config`` that calls
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_forbidden_view`` when scanned.  It should
  be preferred over using ``pyramid.view.view_config`` with
  ``context=HTTPForbidden`` as was previously recommended.

- New APIs: ``pyramid.response.FileResponse`` and
  ``pyramid.response.FileIter``, for usage in views that must serve files
  "manually".

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Remove ``pyramid.config.Configurator.with_context`` class method.  It was
  never an API, it is only used by ``pyramid_zcml`` and its functionality has
  been moved to that package's latest release.  This means that you'll need
  to use the 0.9.2 or later release of ``pyramid_zcml`` with this release of
  Pyramid.

- The ``introspector`` argument to the ``pyramid.config.Configurator``
  constructor API has been removed.  It has been replaced by the boolean
  ``introspection`` flag.

- The ``pyramid.registry.noop_introspector`` API object has been removed.

- The older deprecated ``set_notfound_view`` Configurator method is now an
  alias for the new ``add_notfound_view`` Configurator method.  Likewise, the
  older deprecated ``set_forbidden_view`` is now an alias for the new
  ``add_forbidden_view``. This has the following impact: the ``context`` sent
  to views with a ``(context, request)`` call signature registered via the
  ``set_notfound_view`` or ``set_forbidden_view`` will now be an exception
  object instead of the actual resource context found.  Use
  ``request.context`` to get the actual resource context.  It's also
  recommended to disuse ``set_notfound_view`` in favor of
  ``add_notfound_view``, and disuse ``set_forbidden_view`` in favor of
  ``add_forbidden_view`` despite the aliasing.

Deprecations
------------

- The API documentation for ``pyramid.view.append_slash_notfound_view`` and
  ``pyramid.view.AppendSlashNotFoundViewFactory`` was removed.  These names
  still exist and are still importable, but they are no longer APIs.  Use
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_notfound_view(append_slash=True)`` or
  ``pyramid.view.notfound_view_config(append_slash=True)`` to get the same
  behavior.

- The ``set_forbidden_view`` and ``set_notfound_view`` methods of the
  Configurator were removed from the documentation.  They have been
  deprecated since Pyramid 1.1.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The static file response object used by ``config.add_static_view`` opened
  the static file twice, when it only needed to open it once.

- The AppendSlashNotFoundViewFactory used request.path to match routes.  This
  was wrong because request.path contains the script name, and this would
  cause it to fail in circumstances where the script name was not empty.  It
  should have used request.path_info, and now does.

Documentation
-------------

- Updated the "Creating a Not Found View" section of the "Hooks" chapter,
  replacing explanations of registering a view using ``add_view`` or
  ``view_config`` with ones using ``add_notfound_view`` or
  ``notfound_view_config``.

- Updated the "Creating a Not Forbidden View" section of the "Hooks" chapter,
  replacing explanations of registering a view using ``add_view`` or
  ``view_config`` with ones using ``add_forbidden_view`` or
  ``forbidden_view_config``.

- Updated the "Redirecting to Slash-Appended Routes" section of the "URL
  Dispatch" chapter, replacing explanations of registering a view using
  ``add_view`` or ``view_config`` with ones using ``add_notfound_view`` or
  ``notfound_view_config``

- Updated all tutorials to use ``pyramid.view.forbidden_view_config`` rather
  than ``pyramid.view.view_config`` with an HTTPForbidden context.

1.3a8 (2012-02-19)
==================

Features
--------

- The ``scan`` method of a ``Configurator`` can be passed an ``ignore``
  argument, which can be a string, a callable, or a list consisting of
  strings and/or callables.  This feature allows submodules, subpackages, and
  global objects from being scanned.  See
  http://readthedocs.org/docs/venusian/en/latest/#ignore-scan-argument for
  more information about how to use the ``ignore`` argument to ``scan``.

- Better error messages when a view callable returns a value that cannot be
  converted to a response (for example, when a view callable returns a
  dictionary without a renderer defined, or doesn't return any value at all).
  The error message now contains information about the view callable itself
  as well as the result of calling it.

- Better error message when a .pyc-only module is ``config.include`` -ed.
  This is not permitted due to error reporting requirements, and a better
  error message is shown when it is attempted.  Previously it would fail with
  something like "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute
  'rfind'".

- Add ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_traverser`` API method.  See the
  Hooks narrative documentation section entitled "Changing the Traverser" for
  more information.  This is not a new feature, it just provides an API for
  adding a traverser without needing to use the ZCA API.

- Add ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_resource_url_adapter`` API method.
  See the Hooks narrative documentation section entitled "Changing How
  pyramid.request.Request.resource_url Generates a URL" for more information.
  This is not a new feature, it just provides an API for adding a resource
  url adapter without needing to use the ZCA API.

- The system value ``req`` is now supplied to renderers as an alias for
  ``request``.  This means that you can now, for example, in a template, do
  ``req.route_url(...)`` instead of ``request.route_url(...)``.  This is
  purely a change to reduce the amount of typing required to use request
  methods and attributes from within templates.  The value ``request`` is
  still available too, this is just an alternative.

- A new interface was added: ``pyramid.interfaces.IResourceURL``.  An adapter
  implementing its interface can be used to override resource URL generation
  when ``request.resource_url`` is called.  This interface replaces the
  now-deprecated ``pyramid.interfaces.IContextURL`` interface.

- The dictionary passed to a resource's ``__resource_url__`` method (see
  "Overriding Resource URL Generation" in the "Resources" chapter) now
  contains an ``app_url`` key, representing the application URL generated
  during ``request.resource_url``.  It represents a potentially customized
  URL prefix, containing potentially custom scheme, host and port information
  passed by the user to ``request.resource_url``.  It should be used instead
  of ``request.application_url`` where necessary.

- The ``request.resource_url`` API now accepts these arguments: ``app_url``,
  ``scheme``, ``host``, and ``port``.  The app_url argument can be used to
  replace the URL prefix wholesale during url generation.  The ``scheme``,
  ``host``, and ``port`` arguments can be used to replace the respective
  default values of ``request.application_url`` partially.

- A new API named ``request.resource_path`` now exists.  It works like
  ``request.resource_url`` but produces a relative URL rather than an
  absolute one.

- The ``request.route_url`` API now accepts these arguments: ``_app_url``,
  ``_scheme``, ``_host``, and ``_port``.  The ``_app_url`` argument can be
  used to replace the URL prefix wholesale during url generation.  The
  ``_scheme``, ``_host``, and ``_port`` arguments can be used to replace the
  respective default values of ``request.application_url`` partially.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``pyramid.interfaces.IContextURL`` interface has been deprecated.
  People have been instructed to use this to register a resource url adapter
  in the "Hooks" chapter to use to influence ``request.resource_url`` URL
  generation for resources found via custom traversers since Pyramid 1.0.

  The interface still exists and registering such an adapter still works, but
  this interface will be removed from the software after a few major Pyramid
  releases.  You should replace it with an equivalent
  ``pyramid.interfaces.IResourceURL`` adapter, registered using the new
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_resource_url_adapter`` API.  A
  deprecation warning is now emitted when a
  ``pyramid.interfaces.IContextURL`` adapter is found when
  ``request.resource_url`` is called.

Documentation
-------------

- Don't create a ``session`` instance in SQLA Wiki tutorial, use raw
  ``DBSession`` instead (this is more common in real SQLA apps).

Scaffolding
-----------

- Put ``pyramid.includes`` targets within ini files in scaffolds on separate
  lines in order to be able to tell people to comment out only the
  ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` line when they want to disable the toolbar.

Dependencies
------------

- Depend on ``venusian`` >= 1.0a3 to provide scan ``ignore`` support.

Internal
--------

- Create a "MakoRendererFactoryHelper" that provides customizable settings
  key prefixes.  Allows settings prefixes other than "mako." to be used to
  create different factories that don't use the global mako settings.  This
  will be useful for the debug toolbar, which can currently be sabotaged by
  someone using custom mako configuration settings.

1.3a7 (2012-02-07)
==================

Features
--------

- More informative error message when a ``config.include`` cannot find an
  ``includeme``.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/392.

- Internal: catch unhashable discriminators early (raise an error instead of
  allowing them to find their way into resolveConflicts).

- The `match_param` view predicate now accepts a string or a tuple.
  This replaces the broken behavior of accepting a dict. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/425 for more information.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The process will now restart when ``pserve`` is used with the ``--reload``
  flag when the ``development.ini`` file (or any other .ini file in use) is
  changed.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/377 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/411

- The ``prequest`` script would fail when used against URLs which did not
  return HTML or text.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/381

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The `match_param` view predicate no longer accepts a dict. This will
  have no negative affect because the implementation was broken for
  dict-based arguments.

Documentation
-------------

- Add a traversal hello world example to the narrative docs.

1.3a6 (2012-01-20)
==================

Features
--------

- New API: ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_request_property``. Add lazy
  property descriptors to a request without changing the request factory.
  This method provides conflict detection and is the suggested way to add
  properties to a request.

- Responses generated by Pyramid's ``static_view`` now use
  a ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` (see
  http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#optional-platform-specific-file-handling)
  when one is provided by the web server.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Views registered with an ``accept`` could not be overridden correctly with
  a different view that had the same predicate arguments.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/404 for more information.

- When using a dotted name for a ``view`` argument to
  ``Configurator.add_view`` that pointed to a class with a ``view_defaults``
  decorator, the view defaults would not be applied.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/396 .

- Static URL paths were URL-quoted twice.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/407 .

1.3a5 (2012-01-09)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- The ``pyramid.view.view_defaults`` decorator did not work properly when
  more than one view relied on the defaults being different for configuration
  conflict resolution.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/394.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``path_info`` route and view predicates now match against
  ``request.upath_info`` (Unicode) rather than ``request.path_info``
  (indeterminate value based on Python 3 vs. Python 2).  This has to be done
  to normalize matching on Python 2 and Python 3.

1.3a4 (2012-01-05)
==================

Features
--------

- New API: ``pyramid.request.Request.set_property``. Add lazy property
  descriptors to a request without changing the request factory. New
  properties may be reified, effectively caching the value for the lifetime
  of the instance. Common use-cases for this would be to get a database
  connection for the request or identify the current user.

- Use the ``waitress`` WSGI server instead of ``wsgiref`` in scaffolding.

Bug Fixes
---------

- The documentation of ``pyramid.events.subscriber`` indicated that using it
  as a decorator with no arguments like this::

    @subscriber()
    def somefunc(event):
        pass

  Would register ``somefunc`` to receive all events sent via the registry,
  but this was untrue.  Instead, it would receive no events at all.  This has
  now been fixed and the code matches the documentation.  See also
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/386

- Literal portions of route patterns were not URL-quoted when ``route_url``
  or ``route_path`` was used to generate a URL or path.

- The result of ``route_path`` or ``route_url`` might have been ``unicode``
  or ``str`` depending on the input.  It is now guaranteed to always be
  ``str``.

- URL matching when the pattern contained non-ASCII characters in literal
  parts was indeterminate.  Now the pattern supplied to ``add_route`` is
  assumed to be either: a ``unicode`` value, or a ``str`` value that contains
  only ASCII characters.  If you now want to match the path info from a URL
  that contains high order characters, you can pass the Unicode
  representation of the decoded path portion in the pattern.

- When using a ``traverse=`` route predicate, traversal would fail with a
  URLDecodeError if there were any high-order characters in the traversal
  pattern or in the matched dynamic segments.

- Using a dynamic segment named ``traverse`` in a route pattern like this::

    config.add_route('trav_route', 'traversal/{traverse:.*}')

  Would cause a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when the route was matched and the
  matched portion of the URL contained any high-order characters.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/385 .

- When using a ``*traverse`` stararg in a route pattern, a URL that matched
  that possessed a ``@@`` in its name (signifying a view name) would be
  inappropriately quoted by the traversal machinery during traversal,
  resulting in the view not being found properly. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/382 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/375 .

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- String values passed to ``route_url`` or ``route_path`` that are meant to
  replace "remainder" matches will now be URL-quoted except for embedded
  slashes. For example::

     config.add_route('remain', '/foo*remainder')
     request.route_path('remain', remainder='abc / def')
     # -> '/foo/abc%20/%20def'

  Previously string values passed as remainder replacements were tacked on
  untouched, without any URL-quoting.  But this doesn't really work logically
  if the value passed is Unicode (raw unicode cannot be placed in a URL or in
  a path) and it is inconsistent with the rest of the URL generation
  machinery if the value is a string (it won't be quoted unless by the
  caller).

  Some folks will have been relying on the older behavior to tack on query
  string elements and anchor portions of the URL; sorry, you'll need to
  change your code to use the ``_query`` and/or ``_anchor`` arguments to
  ``route_path`` or ``route_url`` to do this now.

- If you pass a bytestring that contains non-ASCII characters to
  ``add_route`` as a pattern, it will now fail at startup time.  Use Unicode
  instead.

1.3a3 (2011-12-21)
==================

Features
--------

- Added a ``prequest`` script (along the lines of ``paster request``).  It is
  documented in the "Command-Line Pyramid" chapter in the section entitled
  "Invoking a Request".

- Add undocumented ``__discriminator__`` API to derived view callables.
  e.g. ``adapters.lookup(...).__discriminator__(context, request)``.  It will
  be used by superdynamic systems that require the discriminator to be used
  for introspection after manual view lookup.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Normalized exit values and ``-h`` output for all ``p*`` scripts
  (``pviews``, ``proutes``, etc).

Documentation
-------------

- Added a section named "Making Your Script into a Console Script" in the
  "Command-Line Pyramid" chapter.

- Removed the "Running Pyramid on Google App Engine" tutorial from the main
  docs.  It survives on in the Cookbook
  (http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/en/latest/gae.html).
  Rationale: it provides the correct info for the Python 2.5 version of GAE
  only, and this version of Pyramid does not support Python 2.5.

1.3a2 (2011-12-14)
==================

Features
--------

- New API: ``pyramid.view.view_defaults``. If you use a class as a view, you
  can use the new ``view_defaults`` class decorator on the class to provide
  defaults to the view configuration information used by every
  ``@view_config`` decorator that decorates a method of that class.  It also
  works against view configurations involving a class made imperatively.

- Added a backwards compatibility knob to ``pcreate`` to emulate ``paster
  create`` handling for the ``--list-templates`` option.

- Changed scaffolding machinery around a bit to make it easier for people who
  want to have extension scaffolds that can work across Pyramid 1.0.X, 1.1.X,
  1.2.X and 1.3.X.  See the new "Creating Pyramid Scaffolds" chapter in the
  narrative documentation for more info.

Documentation
-------------

- Added documentation to "View Configuration" narrative documentation chapter
  about ``view_defaults`` class decorator.

- Added API docs for ``view_defaults`` class decorator.

- Added an API docs chapter for ``pyramid.scaffolds``.

- Added a narrative docs chapter named "Creating Pyramid Scaffolds".

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``template_renderer`` method of ``pyramid.scaffolds.PyramidScaffold``
  was renamed to ``render_template``.  If you were overriding it, you're a
  bad person, because it wasn't an API before now.  But we're nice so we're
  letting you know.

1.3a1 (2011-12-09)
==================

Features
--------

- Python 3.2 compatibility.

- New ``pyramid.compat`` module and API documentation which provides Python
  2/3 straddling support for Pyramid add-ons and development environments.

- A ``mako.directories`` setting is no longer required to use Mako templates
  Rationale: Mako template renderers can be specified using an absolute asset
  spec.  An entire application can be written with such asset specs,
  requiring no ordered lookup path.

- ``bpython`` interpreter compatibility in ``pshell``.  See the "Command-Line
  Pyramid" narrative docs chapter for more information.

- Added ``get_appsettings`` API function to the ``pyramid.paster`` module.
  This function returns the settings defined within an ``[app:...]`` section
  in a PasteDeploy ini file.

- Added ``setup_logging`` API function to the ``pyramid.paster`` module.
  This function sets up Python logging according to the logging configuration
  in a PasteDeploy ini file.

- Configuration conflict reporting is reported in a more understandable way
  ("Line 11 in file..." vs. a repr of a tuple of similar info).

- A configuration introspection system was added; see the narrative
  documentation chapter entitled "Pyramid Configuration Introspection" for
  more information.  New APIs: ``pyramid.registry.Introspectable``,
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.introspector``,
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.introspectable``,
  ``pyramid.registry.Registry.introspector``.

- Allow extra keyword arguments to be passed to the
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.action`` method.

- New APIs: ``pyramid.path.AssetResolver`` and
  ``pyramid.path.DottedNameResolver``.  The former can be used to resolve
  asset specifications, the latter can be used to resolve dotted names to
  modules or packages.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make test suite pass on 32-bit systems; closes #286.  closes #306.
  See also https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/286

- The ``pryamid.view.view_config`` decorator did not accept a ``match_params``
  predicate argument.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/308

- The AuthTktCookieHelper could potentially generate Unicode headers
  inappropriately when the ``tokens`` argument to remember was used.  See 
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/314.

- The AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy did not use a timing-attack-aware string
  comparator.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/320 for more info.

- The DummySession in ``pyramid.testing`` now generates a new CSRF token if
  one doesn't yet exist.

- ``request.static_url`` now generates URL-quoted URLs when fed a ``path``
  argument which contains characters that are unsuitable for URLs.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/349 for more info.

- Prevent a scaffold rendering from being named ``site`` (conflicts with
  Python internal site.py).

- Support for using instances as targets of the ``pyramid.wsgi.wsgiapp`` and
  ``pryramid.wsgi.wsgiapp2`` functions.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/370 for more info.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Pyramid no longer runs on Python 2.5 (which includes the most recent
  release of Jython and the Python 2.5 version of GAE as of this writing).

- The ``paster`` command is no longer the documented way to create projects,
  start the server, or run debugging commands.  To create projects from
  scaffolds, ``paster create`` is replaced by the ``pcreate`` console script.
  To serve up a project, ``paster serve`` is replaced by the ``pserve``
  console script.  New console scripts named ``pshell``, ``pviews``,
  ``proutes``, and ``ptweens`` do what their ``paster <commandname>``
  equivalents used to do.  Rationale: the Paste and PasteScript packages do
  not run under Python 3.

- The default WSGI server run as the result of ``pserve`` from newly rendered
  scaffolding is now the ``wsgiref`` WSGI server instead of the
  ``paste.httpserver`` server.  Rationale: Rationale: the Paste and
  PasteScript packages do not run under Python 3.

- The ``pshell`` command (see "paster pshell") no longer accepts a
  ``--disable-ipython`` command-line argument.  Instead, it accepts a ``-p``
  or ``--python-shell`` argument, which can be any of the values ``python``,
  ``ipython`` or ``bpython``.

- Removed the ``pyramid.renderers.renderer_from_name`` function.  It has been
  deprecated since Pyramid 1.0, and was never an API.

- To use ZCML with versions of Pyramid >= 1.3, you will need ``pyramid_zcml``
  version >= 0.8 and ``zope.configuration`` version >= 3.8.0.  The
  ``pyramid_zcml`` package version 0.8 is backwards compatible all the way to
  Pyramid 1.0, so you won't be warned if you have older versions installed
  and upgrade Pyramid "in-place"; it may simply break instead.

Dependencies
------------

- Pyramid no longer depends on the ``zope.component`` package, except as a
  testing dependency.

- Pyramid now depends on a zope.interface>=3.8.0, WebOb>=1.2dev,
  repoze.lru>=0.4, zope.deprecation>=3.5.0, translationstring>=0.4 (for
  Python 3 compatibility purposes).  It also, as a testing dependency,
  depends on WebTest>=1.3.1 for the same reason.

- Pyramid no longer depends on the Paste or PasteScript packages.

Documentation
-------------

- The SQLAlchemy Wiki tutorial has been updated.  It now uses
  ``@view_config`` decorators and an explicit database population script.

- Minor updates to the ZODB Wiki tutorial.

- A narrative documentation chapter named "Extending Pyramid Configuration"
  was added; it describes how to add a new directive, and how use the
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.action`` method within custom directives.  It
  also describes how to add introspectable objects.

- A narrative documentation chapter named "Pyramid Configuration
  Introspection" was added.  It describes how to query the introspection
  system.

Scaffolds
---------

- Rendered scaffolds have now been changed to be more relocatable (fewer
  mentions of the package name within files in the package).

- The ``routesalchemy`` scaffold has been renamed ``alchemy``, replacing the
  older (traversal-based) ``alchemy`` scaffold (which has been retired).

- The ``starter`` scaffold now uses URL dispatch by default.
