=======
Next release
============

Bug Fixes
---------

- The ``proutes`` command tried too hard to resolve the view for printing,
  resulting in exceptions when an exceptional root factory was encountered.
  Instead of trying to resolve the view, if it cannot, it will now just print
  ``<unknown>``.

Features
--------

- config.add_view now accepts a 'decorator' keyword argument, a
  callable which will decorate the view callable before it is added to
  the registry

- If a handler class provides an _action_decorator classmethod, use that
  as the decorator for each view registration for that handler.

Documentation
-------------

- The (weak) "Converting a CMF Application to Pyramid" tutorial has been
  removed from the tutorials section.  It was moved to the
  ``pyramid_tutorials`` Github repository.


1.0a8 (2010-12-27)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- The name ``registry`` was not available in the ``paster pshell``
  environment under IPython.

Features
--------

- If a resource implements a ``__resource_url__`` method, it will be called
  as the result of invoking the ``pyramid.url.resource_url`` function to
  generate a URL, overriding the default logic.  See the new "Generating The
  URL Of A Resource" section within the Resources narrative chapter.

- Added flash messaging, as described in the "Flash Messaging" narrative
  documentation chapter.

- Added CSRF token generation, as described in the narrative chapter entitled
  "Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks".

- Prevent misunderstanding of how the ``view`` and ``view_permission``
  arguments to add_route work by raising an exception during configuration if
  view-related arguments exist but no ``view`` argument is passed.

- Add ``paster proute`` command which displays a summary of the routing
  table.  See the narrative documentation section within the "URL Dispatch"
  chapter entitled "Displaying All Application Routes".

Paster Templates
----------------

- The ``pyramid_zodb`` Paster template no longer employs ZCML.  Instead, it
  is based on scanning.

Documentation
-------------

- Added "Generating The URL Of A Resource" section to the Resources narrative
  chapter (includes information about overriding URL generation using
  ``__resource_url__``).

- Added "Generating the Path To a Resource" section to the Resources
  narrative chapter.

- Added "Finding a Resource by Path" section to the Resources narrative
  chapter.

- Added "Obtaining the Lineage of a Resource" to the Resources narrative
  chapter.

- Added "Determining if a Resource is In The Lineage of Another Resource" to
  Resources narrative chapter.

- Added "Finding the Root Resource" to Resources narrative chapter.

- Added "Finding a Resource With a Class or Interface in Lineage" to
  Resources narrative chapter.

- Added a "Flash Messaging" narrative documentation chapter.

- Added a narrative chapter entitled "Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery
  Attacks".

- Changed the "ZODB + Traversal Wiki Tutorial" based on changes to
  ``pyramid_zodb`` Paster template.

- Added "Advanced Configuration" narrative chapter which documents how to
  deal with configuration conflicts, two-phase configuration, ``include`` and
  ``commit``.

- Fix API documentation rendering for ``pyramid.view.static``

- Add "Pyramid Provides More Than One Way to Do It" to Design Defense
  documentation.

- Changed "Static Assets" narrative chapter: clarify that ``name`` represents
  a prefix unless it's a URL, added an example of a root-relative static view
  fallback for URL dispatch, added an example of creating a simple view that
  returns the body of a file.

- Move ZCML usage in Hooks chapter to Declarative Configuration chapter.

- Merge "Static Assets" chapter into the "Assets" chapter.

- Added narrative documentation section within the "URL Dispatch" chapter
  entitled "Displaying All Application Routes" (for ``paster proutes``
  command).

1.0a7 (2010-12-20)
==================

Terminology Changes
-------------------

- The Pyramid concept previously known as "model" is now known as "resource".
  As a result:

  - The following API changes have been made::

      pyramid.url.model_url -> 
                        pyramid.url.resource_url

      pyramid.traversal.find_model -> 
                        pyramid.url.find_resource

      pyramid.traversal.model_path ->
                        pyramid.traversal.resource_path

      pyramid.traversal.model_path_tuple ->
                        pyramid.traversal.resource_path_tuple

      pyramid.traversal.ModelGraphTraverser -> 
                        pyramid.traversal.ResourceTreeTraverser

      pyramid.config.Configurator.testing_models ->
                        pyramid.config.Configurator.testing_resources

      pyramid.testing.registerModels ->
                        pyramid.testing.registerResources

      pyramid.testing.DummyModel ->
                        pyramid.testing.DummyResource

   - All documentation which previously referred to "model" now refers to
     "resource".

   - The ``starter`` and ``starter_zcml`` paster templates now have a
     ``resources.py`` module instead of a ``models.py`` module.

  - Positional argument names of various APIs have been changed from
    ``model`` to ``resource``.

  Backwards compatibility shims have been left in place in all cases.  They
  will continue to work "forever".

- The Pyramid concept previously known as "resource" is now known as "asset".
  As a result:

  - The (non-API) module previously known as ``pyramid.resource`` is now
    known as ``pyramid.asset``.

  - All docs that previously referred to "resource specification" now refer
    to "asset specification".

  - The following API changes were made::

      pyramid.config.Configurator.absolute_resource_spec ->
                        pyramid.config.Configurator.absolute_asset_spec

      pyramid.config.Configurator.override_resource ->
                        pyramid.config.Configurator.override_asset

  - The ZCML directive previously known as ``resource`` is now known as
    ``asset``.

  - The setting previously known as ``BFG_RELOAD_RESOURCES`` (envvar) or
    ``reload_resources`` (config file) is now known, respectively, as
    ``PYRAMID_RELOAD_ASSETS`` and ``reload_assets``.

  Backwards compatibility shims have been left in place in all cases.  They
  will continue to work "forever".

Bug Fixes
---------

- Make it possible to succesfully run all tests via ``nosetests`` command
  directly (rather than indirectly via ``python setup.py nosetests``).

- When a configuration conflict is encountered during scanning, the conflict
  exception now shows the decorator information that caused the conflict.

Features
--------

- Added ``debug_routematch`` configuration setting that logs matched routes
  (including the matchdict and predicates).

- The name ``registry`` is now available in a ``pshell`` environment by
  default.  It is the application registry object.

Environment
-----------

- All environment variables which used to be prefixed with ``BFG_`` are now
  prefixed with ``PYRAMID_`` (e.g. ``BFG_DEBUG_NOTFOUND`` is now
  ``PYRAMID_DEBUG_NOTFOUND``)

Documentation
-------------

- Added "Debugging Route Matching" section to the urldispatch narrative
  documentation chapter.

- Added reference to ``PYRAMID_DEBUG_ROUTEMATCH`` envvar and ``debug_routematch``
  config file setting to the Environment narrative docs chapter.

- Changed "Project" chapter slightly to expand on use of ``paster pshell``.

- Direct Jython users to Mako rather than Jinja2 in "Install" narrative
  chapter.

- Many changes to support terminological renaming of "model" to "resource"
  and "resource" to "asset".

- Added an example of ``WebTest`` functional testing to the testing narrative
  chapter.

- Rearranged chapter ordering by popular demand (URL dispatch first, then
  traversal).  Put hybrid chapter after views chapter.

- Split off "Renderers" as its own chapter from "Views" chapter in narrative
  documentation.

Paster Templates
----------------

- Added ``debug_routematch = false`` to all paster templates.

Dependencies
------------

- Depend on Venusian >= 0.5 (for scanning conflict exception decoration).

1.0a6 (2010-12-15)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- 1.0a5 introduced a bug when ``pyramid.config.Configurator.scan`` was used
  without a ``package`` argument (e.g. ``config.scan()`` as opposed to
  ``config.scan('packagename')``.  The symptoms were: lots of deprecation
  warnings printed to the console about imports of deprecated Pyramid
  functions and classes and non-detection of view callables decorated with
  ``view_config`` decorators.  This has been fixed.

- Tests now pass on Windows (no bugs found, but a few tests in the test suite
  assumed UNIX path segments in filenames).

Documentation
-------------

- If you followed it to-the-letter, the ZODB+Traversal Wiki tutorial would
  instruct you to run a test which would fail because the view callable
  generated by the ``pyramid_zodb`` tutorial used a one-arg view callable,
  but the test in the sample code used a two-arg call.

- Updated ZODB+Traversal tutorial setup.py of all steps to match what's
  generated by ``pyramid_zodb``.

- Fix reference to ``repoze.bfg.traversalwrapper`` in "Models" chapter (point
  at ``pyramid_traversalwrapper`` instead).

1.0a5 (2010-12-14)
==================

Features
--------

- Add a ``handler`` ZCML directive.  This directive does the same thing as
  ``pyramid.configuration.add_handler``.

- A new module named ``pyramid.config`` was added.  It subsumes the duties of
  the older ``pyramid.configuration`` module.

- The new ``pyramid.config.Configurator` class has API methods that the older
  ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator`` class did not: ``with_context`` (a
  classmethod), ``include``, ``action``, and ``commit``.  These methods exist
  for imperative application extensibility purposes.

- The ``pyramid.testing.setUp`` function now accepts an ``autocommit``
  keyword argument, which defaults to ``True``.  If it is passed ``False``,
  the Config object returned by ``setUp`` will be a non-autocommiting Config
  object.

- Add logging configuration to all paster templates.

- ``pyramid_alchemy``, ``pyramid_routesalchemy``, and ``pylons_sqla`` paster
  templates now use idiomatic SQLAlchemy configuration in their respective
  ``.ini`` files and Python code.

- ``pyramid.testing.DummyRequest`` now has a class variable,
  ``query_string``, which defaults to the empty string.

- Add support for json on GAE by catching NotImplementedError and importing
  simplejson from django.utils.

- The Mako renderer now accepts a resource specification for
  ``mako.module_directory``.

- New boolean Mako settings variable ``mako.strict_undefined``.  See `Mako
  Context Variables
  <http://www.makotemplates.org/docs/runtime.html#context-variables>`_ for
  its meaning.

Dependencies
------------

- Depend on Mako 0.3.6+ (we now require the ``strict_undefined`` feature).

Bug Fixes
---------

- When creating a Configurator from within a ``paster pshell`` session, you
  were required to pass a ``package`` argument although ``package`` is not
  actually required.  If you didn't pass ``package``, you would receive an
  error something like ``KeyError: '__name__'`` emanating from the
  ``pyramid.path.caller_module`` function.  This has now been fixed.

- The ``pyramid_routesalchemy`` paster template's unit tests failed
  (``AssertionError: 'SomeProject' != 'someproject'``).  This is fixed.

- Make default renderer work (renderer factory registered with no name, which
  is active for every view unless the view names a specific renderer).

- The Mako renderer did not properly turn the ``mako.imports``,
  ``mako.default_filters``, and ``mako.imports`` settings into lists.

- The Mako renderer did not properly convert the ``mako.error_handler``
  setting from a dotted name to a callable.

Documentation
-------------

- Merged many wording, readability, and correctness changes to narrative
  documentation chapters from https://github.com/caseman/pyramid (up to and
  including "Models" narrative chapter).

- "Sample Applications" section of docs changed to note existence of Cluegun,
  Shootout and Virginia sample applications, ported from their repoze.bfg
  origin packages.

- SQLAlchemy+URLDispatch tutorial updated to integrate changes to
  ``pyramid_routesalchemy`` template.

- Add ``pyramid.interfaces.ITemplateRenderer`` interface to Interfaces API
  chapter (has ``implementation()`` method, required to be used when getting
  at Chameleon macros).

- Add a "Modifying Package Structure" section to the project narrative
  documentation chapter (explain turning a module into a package).

- Documentation was added for the new ``handler`` ZCML directive in the ZCML
  section.

Deprecations
------------

- ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator`` is now deprecated.  Use
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator``, passing its constructor
  ``autocommit=True`` instead.  The ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator``
  alias will live for a long time, as every application uses it, but its
  import now issues a deprecation warning.  The
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator`` class has the same API as
  ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator`` class, which it means to replace,
  except by default it is a *non-autocommitting* configurator. The
  now-deprecated ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator`` will autocommit every
  time a configuration method is called.

  The ``pyramid.configuration`` module remains, but it is deprecated.  Use
  ``pyramid.config`` instead.

1.0a4 (2010-11-21)
==================

Features
--------

- URL Dispatch now allows for replacement markers to be located anywhere
  in the pattern, instead of immediately following a ``/``.

- URL Dispatch now uses the form ``{marker}`` to denote a replace marker in
  the route pattern instead of ``:marker``. The old colon-style marker syntax
  is still accepted for backwards compatibility. The new format allows a
  regular expression for that marker location to be used instead of the
  default ``[^/]+``, for example ``{marker:\d+}`` is now valid to require the
  marker to be digits.

- Add a ``pyramid.url.route_path`` API, allowing folks to generate relative
  URLs.  Calling ``route_path`` is the same as calling
  ``pyramid.url.route_url`` with the argument ``_app_url`` equal to the empty
  string.

- Add a ``pyramid.request.Request.route_path`` API.  This is a convenience
  method of the request which calls ``pyramid.url.route_url``.

- Make test suite pass on Jython (requires PasteScript trunk, presumably to
  be 1.7.4).

- Make test suite pass on PyPy (Chameleon doesn't work).

- Surrounding application configuration with ``config.begin()`` and
  ``config.end()`` is no longer necessary.  All paster templates have been
  changed to no longer call these functions.

- Fix configurator to not convert ``ImportError`` to ``ConfigurationError``
  if the import that failed was unrelated to the import requested via a
  dotted name when resolving dotted names (such as view dotted names).

Documentation
-------------

- SQLAlchemy+URLDispatch and ZODB+Traversal tutorials have been updated to
  not call ``config.begin()`` or ``config.end()``.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Add deprecation warnings to import of ``pyramid.chameleon_text`` and
  ``pyramid.chameleon_zpt`` of ``get_renderer``, ``get_template``,
  ``render_template``, and ``render_template_to_response``.

- Add deprecation warning for import of ``pyramid.zcml.zcml_configure`` and
  ``pyramid.zcml.file_configure``.

- The ``pyramid_alchemy`` paster template had a typo, preventing an import
  from working.

- Fix apparent failures when calling ``pyramid.traversal.find_model(root,
  path)`` or ``pyramid.traversal.traverse(path)`` when ``path`` is
  (erroneously) a Unicode object. The user is meant to pass these APIs a
  string object, never a Unicode object.  In practice, however, users indeed
  pass Unicode.  Because the string that is passed must be ASCII encodeable,
  now, if they pass a Unicode object, its data is eagerly converted to an
  ASCII string rather than being passed along to downstream code as a
  convenience to the user and to prevent puzzling second-order failures from
  cropping up (all failures will occur within ``pyramid.traversal.traverse``
  rather than later down the line as the result of calling e.g.
  ``traversal_path``).

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``pyramid.testing.zcml_configure`` API has been removed.  It had been
  advertised as removed since repoze.bfg 1.2a1, but hadn't actually been.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``pyramid.settings.get_settings`` API is now deprecated.  Use
  ``pyramid.threadlocals.get_current_registry().settings`` instead or use the
  ``settings`` attribute of the registry available from the request
  (``request.registry.settings``).

Documentation
-------------

- Removed ``zodbsessions`` tutorial chapter.  It's still useful, but we now
  have a SessionFactory abstraction which competes with it, and maintaining
  documentation on both ways to do it is a distraction.

Internal
--------

- Replace Twill with WebTest in internal integration tests (avoid deprecation
  warnings generated by Twill).

1.0a3 (2010-11-16)
==================

Features
--------

- Added Mako TemplateLookup settings for ``mako.error_handler``,
  ``mako.default_filters``, and ``mako.imports``.

- Normalized all paster templates: each now uses the name ``main`` to
  represent the function that returns a WSGI application, each now uses
  WebError, each now has roughly the same shape of development.ini style.

- Added class vars ``matchdict`` and ``matched_route`` to
  ``pyramid.request.Request``.  Each is set to ``None``.

- New API method: ``pyramid.settings.asbool``.

- New API methods for ``pyramid.request.Request``: ``model_url``,
  ``route_url``, and ``static_url``.  These are simple passthroughs for their
  respective functions in ``pyramid.url``.

- The ``settings`` object which used to be available only when
  ``request.settings.get_settings`` was called is now available as
  ``registry.settings`` (e.g. ``request.registry.settings`` in view code).

Bug Fixes
---------

- The pylons_* paster templates erroneously used the ``{squiggly}`` routing
  syntax as the pattern supplied to ``add_route``.  This style of routing is
  not supported.  They were replaced with ``:colon`` style route patterns.

- The pylons_* paster template used the same string
  (``your_app_secret_string``) for the ``session.secret`` setting in the
  generated ``development.ini``.  This was a security risk if left unchanged
  in a project that used one of the templates to produce production
  applications.  It now uses a randomly generated string.

Documentation
-------------

- ZODB+traversal wiki (``wiki``) tutorial updated due to changes to
  ``pyramid_zodb`` paster template.

- SQLAlchemy+urldispach wiki (``wiki2``) tutorial updated due to changes to
  ``pyramid_routesalchemy`` paster template.

- Documented the ``matchdict`` and ``matched_route`` attributes of the
  request object in the Request API documentation.

Deprecations
------------

- Obtaining the ``settings`` object via
  ``registry.{get|query}Utility(ISettings)`` is now deprecated.  Instead,
  obtain the ``settings`` object via the ``registry.settings`` attribute.  A
  backwards compatibility shim was added to the registry object to register
  the settings object as an ISettings utility when ``setattr(registry,
  'settings', foo)`` is called, but it will be removed in a later release.

- Obtaining the ``settings`` object via ``pyramid.settings.get_settings`` is
  now deprecated.  Obtain it as the ``settings`` attribute of the registry
  now (obtain the registry via ``pyramid.threadlocal.get_registry`` or as
  ``request.registry``).

Behavior Differences
--------------------

- Internal: ZCML directives no longer call get_current_registry() if there's
  a ``registry`` attribute on the ZCML context (kill off use of
  threadlocals).

- Internal: Chameleon template renderers now accept two arguments: ``path``
  and ``lookup``.  ``Lookup`` will be an instance of a lookup class which
  supplies (late-bound) arguments for debug, reload, and translate.  Any
  third-party renderers which use (the non-API) function
  ``pyramid.renderers.template_renderer_factory`` will need to adjust their
  implementations to obey the new callback argument list.  This change was to
  kill off inappropriate use of threadlocals.

1.0a2 (2010-11-09)
==================

Documentation
-------------

- All references to events by interface
  (e.g. ``pyramid.interfaces.INewRequest``) have been changed to reference
  their concrete classes (e.g. ``pyramid.events.NewRequest``) in
  documentation about making subscriptions.

- All references to Pyramid-the-application were changed from mod-`pyramid`
  to app-`Pyramid`.  A custom role setting was added to ``docs/conf.py`` to
  allow for this.  (internal)

1.0a1 (2010-11-05)
==================

Features (delta from BFG 1.3)
-------------------------------

- Mako templating renderer supports resource specification format for
  template lookups and within Mako templates. Absolute filenames must
  be used in Pyramid to avoid this lookup process.

- Add ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` module, which is a facade for the
  ``webob.exc`` module.

- Direct built-in support for the Mako templating language.

- A new configurator method exists: ``add_handler``.  This method adds
  a Pylons-style "view handler" (such a thing used to be called a
  "controller" in Pylons 1.0).

- New argument to configurator: ``session_factory``.

- New method on configurator: ``set_session_factory``

- Using ``request.session`` now returns a (dictionary-like) session
  object if a session factory has been configured.

- The request now has a new attribute: ``tmpl_context`` for benefit of
  Pylons users.

- The decorator previously known as ``pyramid.view.bfg_view`` is now
  known most formally as ``pyramid.view.view_config`` in docs and
  paster templates.  An import of ``pyramid.view.bfg_view``, however,
  will continue to work "forever".

- New API methods in ``pyramid.session``: ``signed_serialize`` and
  ``signed_deserialize``.

- New interface: ``pyramid.interfaces.IRendererInfo``.  An object of this type
  is passed to renderer factory constructors (see "Backwards
  Incompatibilities").

- New event type: ``pyramid.interfaces.IBeforeRender``.  An object of this type
  is sent as an event before a renderer is invoked (but after the
  application-level renderer globals factory added via
  ``pyramid.configurator.configuration.set_renderer_globals_factory``, if any,
  has injected its own keys).  Applications may now subscribe to the
  ``IBeforeRender`` event type in order to introspect the and modify the set of
  renderer globals before they are passed to a renderer.  The event object
  iself has a dictionary-like interface that can be used for this purpose.  For
  example::

    from repoze.events import subscriber
    from pyramid.interfaces import IRendererGlobalsEvent

    @subscriber(IRendererGlobalsEvent)
    def add_global(event):
        event['mykey'] = 'foo'

  If a subscriber attempts to add a key that already exist in the renderer
  globals dictionary, a ``KeyError`` is raised.  This limitation is due to the
  fact that subscribers cannot be ordered relative to each other.  The set of
  keys added to the renderer globals dictionary by all subscribers and
  app-level globals factories must be unique.

- New class: ``pyramid.response.Response``.  This is a pure facade for
  ``webob.Response`` (old code need not change to use this facade, it's
  existence is mostly for vanity and documentation-generation purposes).

- All preexisting paster templates (except ``zodb``) now use "imperative"
  configuration (``starter``, ``routesalchemy``, ``alchemy``).

- A new paster template named ``pyramid_starter_zcml`` exists, which uses
  declarative configuration.

Documentation (delta from BFG 1.3)
-----------------------------------

- Added a ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` API documentation chapter.

- Added a ``pyramid.session`` API documentation chapter.

- Added a ``Session Objects`` narrative documentation chapter.

- Added an API chapter for the ``pyramid.personality`` module.

- Added an API chapter for the ``pyramid.response`` module.

- All documentation which previously referred to ``webob.Response`` now uses
  ``pyramid.response.Response`` instead.

- The documentation has been overhauled to use imperative configuration,
  moving declarative configuration (ZCML) explanations to a separate
  narrative chapter ``declarative.rst``.

- The ZODB Wiki tutorial was updated to take into account changes to the
  ``pyramid_zodb`` paster template.

- The SQL Wiki tutorial was updated to take into account changes to the
  ``pyramid_routesalchemy`` paster template.

Backwards Incompatibilities (with BFG 1.3)
------------------------------------------

- There is no longer an ``IDebugLogger`` registered as a named utility
  with the name ``repoze.bfg.debug``.

- The logger which used to have the name of ``repoze.bfg.debug`` now
  has the name ``pyramid.debug``.

- The deprecated API ``pyramid.testing.registerViewPermission``
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.testing.registerRoutesMapper``
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.request.get_request`` was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.security.Unauthorized`` was
  removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.view_execution_permitted``
  was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.NotFound`` was removed.

- The ``bfgshell`` paster command is now named ``pshell``.

- The Venusian "category" for all built-in Venusian decorators
  (e.g. ``subscriber`` and ``view_config``/``bfg_view``) is now
  ``pyramid`` instead of ``bfg``.

- ``pyramid.renderers.rendered_response`` function removed; use
  ``render_pyramid.renderers.render_to_response`` instead.

- Renderer factories now accept a *renderer info object* rather than an
  absolute resource specification or an absolute path.  The object has the
  following attributes: ``name`` (the ``renderer=`` value), ``package`` (the
  'current package' when the renderer configuration statement was found),
  ``type``: the renderer type, ``registry``: the current registry, and
  ``settings``: the deployment settings dictionary.

  Third-party ``repoze.bfg`` renderer implementations that must be ported to
  Pyramid will need to account for this.

  This change was made primarily to support more flexible Mako template
  rendering.

- The presence of the key ``repoze.bfg.message`` in the WSGI environment when
  an exception occurs is now deprecated.  Instead, code which relies on this
  environ value should use the ``exception`` attribute of the request
  (e.g. ``request.exception[0]``) to retrieve the message.

- The values ``bfg_localizer`` and ``bfg_locale_name`` kept on the request
  during internationalization for caching purposes were never APIs.  These
  however have changed to ``localizer`` and ``locale_name``, respectively.

- The default ``cookie_name`` value of the ``authtktauthenticationpolicy`` ZCML
  now defaults to ``auth_tkt`` (it used to default to ``repoze.bfg.auth_tkt``).

- The default ``cookie_name`` value of the
  ``pyramid.authentication.AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy`` constructor now
  defaults to ``auth_tkt`` (it used to default to ``repoze.bfg.auth_tkt``).

- The ``request_type`` argument to the ``view`` ZCML directive, the
  ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator.add_view`` method, or the
  ``pyramid.view.view_config`` decorator (nee ``bfg_view``) is no longer
  permitted to be one of the strings ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``PUT``, ``POST`` or
  ``DELETE``, and now must always be an interface.  Accepting the
  method-strings as ``request_type`` was a backwards compatibility strategy
  servicing repoze.bfg 1.0 applications.  Use the ``request_method``
  parameter instead to specify that a view a string request-method predicate.
