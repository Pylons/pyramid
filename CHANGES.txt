1.1 (2009-11-15)
================

Internals
---------

- Remove dead IRouteRequirement interface from ``repoze.bfg.zcml``
  module.

Documentation
-------------

- Improve the "Extending an Existing Application" narrative chapter.

- Add more sections to the "Defending Design" chapter.

1.1b4 (2009-11-12)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Use ``alsoProvides`` in the urldispatch module to attach an
  interface to the request rather than ``directlyProvides`` to avoid
  disturbing interfaces set in a NewRequest event handler.

Documentation
-------------

- Move 1.0.1 and previous changelog to HISTORY.txt.

- Add examples to ``repoze.bfg.url.model_url`` docstring.

- Add "Defending BFG Design" chapter to frontpage docs.

Templates
---------

- Remove ``ez_setup.py`` and its import from all paster templates,
  samples, and tutorials for ``distribute`` compatibility.  The
  documentation already explains how to install virtualenv (which will
  include some ``setuptools`` package), so these files, imports and
  usages were superfluous.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``options`` kw arg to the ``repoze.bfg.router.make_app``
  function is deprecated.  In its place is the keyword argument
  ``settings``.  The ``options`` keyword continues to work, and a
  deprecation warning is not emitted when it is detected.  However,
  the paster templates, code samples, and documentation now make
  reference to ``settings`` rather than ``options``.  This
  change/deprecation was mainly made for purposes of clarity and
  symmetry with the ``get_settings()`` API and dicussions of
  "settings" in various places in the docs: we want to use the same
  name to refer to the same thing everywhere.

1.1b3 (2009-11-06)
==================

Features
--------

- ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerRoutesMapper`` testing facility added.
  This testing function registers a routes "mapper" object in the
  registry, for tests which require its presence.  This function is
  documented in the ``repoze.bfg.testing`` API documentation.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Compound statements that used an assignment entered into in an
  interactive IPython session invoked via ``paster bfgshell`` no
  longer fail to mutate the shell namespace correctly.  For example,
  this set of statements used to fail::

    In [2]: def bar(x): return x
      ...:
    In [3]: list(bar(x) for x in 'abc')
    Out[3]: NameError: 'bar'

  In this release, the ``bar`` function is found and the correct
  output is now sent to the console.  Thanks to Daniel Holth for the
  patch.

- The ``bfgshell`` command did not function properly; it was still
  expecting to be able to call the root factory with a bare
  ``environ`` rather than a request object.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.scripting.get_root`` function now expects a
  ``request`` object as its second argument rather than an
  ``environ``.

1.1b2 (2009-11-02)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Prevent PyPI installation failure due to ``easy_install`` trying way
  too hard to guess the best version of Paste.  When ``easy_install``
  pulls from PyPI it reads links off various pages to determine "more
  up to date" versions. It incorrectly picks up a link for an ancient
  version of a package named "Paste-Deploy-0.1" (note the dash) when
  trying to find the "Paste" distribution and somehow believes it's
  the latest version of "Paste".  It also somehow "helpfully" decides
  to check out a version of this package from SVN.  We pin the Paste
  dependency version to a version greater than 1.7 to work around
  this ``easy_install`` bug.

Documentation
-------------

- Fix "Hybrid" narrative chapter: stop claiming that ``<view>``
  statements that mention a route_name need to come afer (in XML
  order) the ``<route>`` statement which creates the route.  This
  hasn't been true since 1.1a1.

- "What's New in ``repoze.bfg`` 1.1" document added to narrative
  documentation.

Features
--------

- Add a new event type: ``repoze.bfg.events.AfterTraversal``.  Events
  of this type will be sent after traversal is completed, but before
  any view code is invoked.  Like ``repoze.bfg.events.NewRequest``,
  This event will have a single attribute: ``request`` representing
  the current request.  Unlike the request attribute of
  ``repoze.bfg.events.NewRequest`` however, during an AfterTraversal
  event, the request object will possess attributes set by the
  traverser, most notably ``context``, which will be the context used
  when a view is found and invoked.  The interface
  ``repoze.bfg.events.IAfterTraversal`` can be used to subscribe to
  the event.  For example::

    <subscriber for="repoze.bfg.interfaces.IAfterTraversal"
                handler="my.app.handle_after_traverse"/>

  Like any framework event, a subscriber function should expect one
  parameter: ``event``.

Dependencies
------------

- Rather than depending on ``chameleon.core`` and ``chameleon.zpt``
  distributions individually, depend on Malthe's repackaged
  ``Chameleon`` distribution (which includes both ``chameleon.core``
  and ``chameleon.zpt``).

1.1b1 (2009-11-01)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- The routes root factory called route factories and the default route
  factory with an environ rather than a request.  One of the symptoms
  of this bug: applications generated using the ``bfg_zodb`` paster
  template in 1.1a9 did not work properly.

- Reinstate ``renderer`` alias for ``view_renderer`` in the
  ``<route>`` ZCML directive (in-the-wild 1.1a bw compat).

- ``bfg_routesalchemy`` paster template: change ``<route>``
  declarations: rename ``renderer`` attribute to ``view_renderer``.

- Header values returned by the ``authtktauthenticationpolicy``
  ``remember`` and ``forget`` methods would be of type ``unicode``.
  This violated the WSGI spec, causing a ``TypeError`` to be raised
  when these headers were used under ``mod_wsgi``.

- If a BFG app that had a route matching the root URL was mounted
  under a path in modwsgi, ala ``WSGIScriptAlias /myapp
  /Users/chrism/projects/modwsgi/env/bfg.wsgi``, the home route (a
  route with the path of ``'/'`` or ``''``) would not match when the
  path ``/myapp`` was visited (only when the path ``/myapp/`` was
  visited).  This is now fixed: if the urldispatch root factory notes
  that the PATH_INFO is empty, it converts it to a single slash before
  trying to do matching.

Documentation
-------------

- In ``<route>`` declarations in tutorial ZCML, rename ``renderer``
  attribute to ``view_renderer`` (fwd compat).

- Fix various tutorials broken by 1.1a9 ``<route>`` directive changes.

Internal
--------

- Deal with a potential circref in the traversal module.

1.1a9 (2009-10-31)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- An incorrect ZCML conflict would be encountered when the
  ``request_param`` predicate attribute was used on the ZCML ``view``
  directive if any two otherwise same-predicated views had the
  combination of a predicate value with an ``=`` sign and one without
  (e.g. ``a`` vs. ``a=123``).

Features
--------

- In previous versions of BFG, the "root factory" (the ``get_root``
  callable passed to ``make_app`` or a function pointed to by the
  ``factory`` attribute of a route) was called with a "bare" WSGI
  environment.  In this version, and going forward, it will be called
  with a ``request`` object.  The request object passed to the factory
  implements dictionary-like methods in such a way that existing root
  factory code which expects to be passed an environ will continue to
  work.

- The ``__call__`` of a plugin "traverser" implementation (registered
  as an adapter for ``ITraverser`` or ``ITraverserFactory``) will now
  receive a *request* as the single argument to its ``__call__``
  method.  In previous versions it was passed a WSGI ``environ``
  object.  The request object passed to the factory implements
  dictionary-like methods in such a way that existing traverser code
  which expects to be passed an environ will continue to work.

- The ZCML ``route`` directive's attributes ``xhr``,
  ``request_method``, ``path_info``, ``request_param``, ``header`` and
  ``accept`` are now *route* predicates rather than *view* predicates.
  If one or more of these predicates is specified in the route
  configuration, all of the predicates must return true for the route
  to match a request.  If one or more of the route predicates
  associated with a route returns ``False`` when checked during a
  request, the route match fails, and the next match in the routelist
  is tried.  This differs from the previous behavior, where no route
  predicates existed and all predicates were considered view
  predicates, because in that scenario, the next route was not tried.

Documentation
-------------

- Various changes were made to narrative and API documentation
  supporting the change from passing a request rather than an environ
  to root factories and traversers.

Internal
--------

- The request implements dictionary-like methods that mutate and query
  the WSGI environ.  This is only for the purpose of backwards
  compatibility with root factories which expect an ``environ`` rather
  than a request.

- The ``repoze.bfg.request.create_route_request_factory`` function,
  which returned a request factory was removed in favor of a
  ``repoze.bfg.request.route_request_interface`` function, which
  returns an interface.

- The ``repoze.bfg.request.Request`` class, which is a subclass of
  ``webob.Request`` now defines its own ``__setattr__``,
  ``__getattr__`` and ``__delattr__`` methods, which override the
  default WebOb behavior.  The default WebOb behavior stores
  attributes of the request in ``self.environ['webob.adhoc_attrs']``,
  and retrieves them from that dictionary during a ``__getattr__``.
  This behavior was undesirable for speed and "expectation" reasons.
  Now attributes of the ``request`` are stored in ``request.__dict__``
  (as you otherwise might expect from an object that did not override
  these methods).

- The router no longer calls ``repoze.bfg.traversal._traverse`` and
  does its work "inline" (speed).

- Reverse the order in which the router calls the request factory and
  the root factory.  The request factory is now called first; the
  resulting request is passed to the root factory.

- The ``repoze.bfg.request.request_factory`` function has been
  removed.  Its functionality is no longer required.

- The "routes root factory" that wraps the default root factory when
  there are routes mentioned in the configuration now attaches an
  interface to the request via ``zope.interface.directlyProvides``.
  This replaces logic in the (now-gone)
  ``repoze.bfg.request.request_factory`` function.

- The ``route`` and ``view`` ZCML directives now register an interface
  as a named utility (retrieved from
  ``repoze.bfg.request.route_request_interface``) rather than a
  request factory (the previous return value of the now-missing 
  ``repoze.bfg.request.create_route_request_factory``.

- The ``repoze.bfg.functional`` module was renamed to
  ``repoze.bfg.compat``.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Explicitly revert the feature introduced in 1.1a8: where the name
  ``root`` is available as an attribute of the request before a
  NewRequest event is emitted.  This makes some potential future
  features impossible, or at least awkward (such as grouping traversal
  and view lookup into a single adapter lookup).

- The ``containment``, ``attr`` and ``renderer`` attributes of the
  ``route`` ZCML directive were removed.

1.1a8 (2009-10-27)
==================

Features
--------

- Add ``path_info`` view configuration predicate.

- ``paster bfgshell`` now supports IPython if it's available for
  import.  Thanks to Daniel Holth for the initial patch.

- Add ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerSettings`` API, which is documented
  in the "repoze.bfg.testing" API chapter.  This allows for
  registration of "settings" values obtained via
  ``repoze.bfg.settings.get_settings()`` for use in unit tests.

- The name ``root`` is available as an attribute of the request
  slightly earlier now (before a NewRequest event is emitted).
  ``root`` is the result of the application "root factory".

- Added ``max_age`` parameter to ``authtktauthenticationpolicy`` ZCML
  directive.  If this value is set, it must be an integer representing
  the number of seconds which the auth tkt cookie will survive.
  Mainly, its existence allows the auth_tkt cookie to survive across
  browser sessions.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix bug encountered during "scan" (when ``<scan ..>`` directive is
  used in ZCML) introduced in 1.1a7.  Symptom: ``AttributeError:
  object has no attribute __provides__`` raised at startup time.

- The ``reissue_time`` argument to the ``authtktauthenticationpolicy``
  ZCML directive now actually works.  When it is set to an integer
  value, an authticket set-cookie header is appended to the response
  whenever a request requires authentication and 'now' minus the
  authticket's timestamp is greater than ``reissue_time`` seconds.

Documentation
-------------

- Add a chapter titled "Request and Response" to the narrative
  documentation, content cribbed from the WebOb documentation.

- Call out predicate attributes of ZCML directive within "Views"
  chapter.

- Fix route_url documentation (``_query`` argument documented as
  ``query`` and ``_anchor`` argument documented as ``anchor``).

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``authtkt`` authentication policy ``remember`` method now no
  longer honors ``token`` or ``userdata`` keyword arguments.

Internal
--------

- Change how ``bfg_view`` decorator works when used as a class method
  decorator.  In 1.1a7, the``scan``directive actually tried to grope
  every class in scanned package at startup time, calling ``dir``
  against each found class, and subsequently invoking ``getattr``
  against each thing found by ``dir`` to see if it was a method.  This
  led to some strange symptoms (e.g. ``AttributeError: object has no
  attribute __provides__``), and was generally just a bad idea.  Now,
  instead of groping classes for methods at startup time, we just
  cause the ``bfg_view`` decorator itself to populate the method's
  class' ``__dict__`` when it is used as a method decorator.  This
  also requires a nasty _getframe thing but it's slightly less nasty
  than the startup time groping behavior.  This is essentially a
  reversion back to 1.1a6 "grokking" behavior plus some special magic
  for using the ``bfg_view`` decorator as method decorator inside the
  ``bfg_view`` class itself.

- The router now checks for a ``global_response_headers`` attribute of
  the request object before returning a response.  If this value
  exists, it is presumed to be a sequence of two-tuples, representing
  a set of headers to append to the 'normal' response headers.  This
  feature is internal, rather than exposed externally, because it's
  unclear whether it will stay around in the long term.  It was added
  to support the ``reissue_time`` feature of the authtkt
  authentication policy.

- The interface ITraverserFactory is now just an alias for ITraverser.

1.1a7 (2009-10-18)
==================

Features
--------

- More than one ``@bfg_view`` decorator may now be stacked on top of
  any number of others.  Each invocation of the decorator registers a
  single view configuration.  For instance, the following combination
  of decorators and a function will register two view configurations
  for the same view callable::

    from repoze.bfg.view import bfg_view

    @bfg_view(name='edit')
    @bfg_view(name='change')
    def edit(context, request):
        pass

  This makes it possible to associate more than one view configuration
  with a single callable without requiring any ZCML.

- The ``@bfg_view`` decorator can now be used against a class method::

    from webob import Response
    from repoze.bfg.view import bfg_view

    class MyView(object):
        def __init__(self, context, request):
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        @bfg_view(name='hello')
        def amethod(self):
            return Response('hello from %s!' % self.context)

  When the bfg_view decorator is used against a class method, a view
  is registered for the *class* (it's a "class view" where the "attr"
  happens to be the name of the method it is attached to), so the
  class it's defined within must have a suitable constructor: one that
  accepts ``context, request`` or just ``request``.

Documentation
-------------

- Added ``Changing the Traverser`` and ``Changing How
  :mod:`repoze.bfg.url.model_url` Generates a URL`` to the "Hooks"
  narrative chapter of the docs.

Internal
--------

- Remove ``ez_setup.py`` and imports of it within ``setup.py``.  In
  the new world, and as per virtualenv setup instructions, people will
  already have either setuptools or distribute.

1.1a6 (2009-10-15)
==================

Features
--------

- Add ``xhr``, ``accept``, and ``header`` view configuration
  predicates to ZCML view declaration, ZCML route declaration, and
  ``bfg_view`` decorator.  See the ``Views`` narrative documentation
  chapter for more information about these predicates.

- Add ``setUp`` and ``tearDown`` functions to the
  ``repoze.bfg.testing`` module.  Using ``setUp`` in a test setup and
  ``tearDown`` in a test teardown is now the recommended way to do
  component registry setup and teardown.  Previously, it was
  recommended that a single function named
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp`` be called in both the test setup and
  tear down.  ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp`` still exists (and will
  exist "forever" due to its widespread use); it is now just an alias
  for ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` and is nominally deprecated.

- The BFG component registry is now available in view and event
  subscriber code as an attribute of the request
  ie. ``request.registry``.  This fact is currently undocumented
  except for this note, because BFG developers never need to interact
  with the registry directly anywhere else.

- The BFG component registry now inherits from ``dict``, meaning that
  it can optionally be used as a simple dictionary.  *Component*
  registrations performed against it via e.g. ``registerUtility``,
  ``registerAdapter``, and similar API methods are kept in a
  completely separate namespace than its dict members, so using the
  its component API methods won't effect the keys and values in the
  dictionary namespace.  Likewise, though the component registry
  "happens to be" a dictionary, use of mutating dictionary methods
  such as ``__setitem__`` will have no influence on any component
  registrations made against it.  In other words, the registry object
  you obtain via e.g. ``repoze.bfg.threadlocal.get_current_registry``
  or ``request.registry`` happens to be both a component registry and
  a dictionary, but using its component-registry API won't impact data
  added to it via its dictionary API and vice versa.  This is a
  forward compatibility move based on the goals of "marco".

- Expose and document ``repoze.bfg.testing.zcml_configure`` API.  This
  function populates a component registry from a ZCML file for testing
  purposes.  It is documented in the "Unit and Integration Testing"
  chapter.

Documentation
-------------

- Virtual hosting narrative docs chapter updated with info about
  ``mod_wsgi``.

- Point all index URLs at the literal 1.1 index (this alpha cycle may
  go on a while).

- Various tutorial test modules updated to use
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` and ``repoze.bfg.testing.tearDown``
  methods in order to encourage this as best practice going forward.

- Added "Creating Integration Tests" section to unit testing narrative
  documentation chapter.  As a result, the name of the unittesting
  chapter is now "Unit and Integration Testing".

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- Importing ``getSiteManager`` and ``get_registry`` from
  ``repoze.bfg.registry`` is no longer supported.  These imports were
  deprecated in repoze.bfg 1.0.  Import of ``getSiteManager`` should
  be done as ``from zope.component import getSiteManager``.  Import of
  ``get_registry`` should be done as ``from repoze.bfg.threadlocal
  import get_current_registry``.  This was done to prevent a circular
  import dependency.

- Code bases which alternately invoke both
  ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` and ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp``
  (treating them equivalently, using them interchangeably) in the
  setUp/tearDown of unit tests will begin to experience test failures
  due to lack of test isolation.  The "right" mechanism is
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp`` (or the combination of
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.tearDown``). but a good number of legacy
  codebases will use ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` instead.  We
  support ``zope.testing.cleanup.cleanUp`` but not in combination with
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp`` in the same codebase.  You should use
  one or the other test cleanup function in a single codebase, but not
  both.

Internal
--------

- Created new ``repoze.bfg.configuration`` module which assumes
  responsibilities previously held by the ``repoze.bfg.registry`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.router`` modules (avoid a circular import dependency).

- The result of the ``zope.component.getSiteManager`` function in unit
  tests set up with ``repoze.bfg.testing.cleanUp`` or
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.setUp`` will be an instance of
  ``repoze.bfg.registry.Registry`` instead of the global
  ``zope.component.globalregistry.base`` registry.  This also means
  that the threadlocal ZCA API functions such as ``getAdapter`` and
  ``getUtility`` as well as internal BFG machinery (such as
  ``model_url`` and ``route_url``) will consult this registry within
  unit tests. This is a forward compatibility move based on the goals
  of "marco".

- Removed ``repoze.bfg.testing.addCleanUp`` function and associated
  module-scope globals.  This was never an API.

1.1a5 (2009-10-10)
==================

Documentation
-------------

- Change "Traversal + ZODB" and "URL Dispatch + SQLAlchemy" Wiki
  tutorials to make use of the new-to-1.1 "renderer" feature (return
  dictionaries from all views).

- Add tests to the "URL Dispatch + SQLAlchemy" tutorial after the
  "view" step.

- Added a diagram of model graph traversal to the "Traversal"
  narrative chapter of the documentation.

- An ``exceptions`` API chapter was added, documenting the new
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions`` module.

- Describe "request-only" view calling conventions inside the
  urldispatch narrative chapter, where it's most helpful.

- Add a diagram which explains the operation of the BFG router to the
  "Router" narrative chapter.

Features
--------

- Add a new ``repoze.bfg.testing`` API: ``registerRoute``, for
  registering routes to satisfy calls to
  e.g. ``repoze.bfg.url.route_url`` in unit tests.

- The ``notfound`` and ``forbidden`` ZCML directives now accept the
  following addtional attributes: ``attr``, ``renderer``, and
  ``wrapper``.  These have the same meaning as they do in the context
  of a ZCML ``view`` directive.

- For behavior like Django's ``APPEND_SLASH=True``, use the
  ``repoze.bfg.view.append_slash_notfound_view`` view as the Not Found
  view in your application.  When this view is the Not Found view
  (indicating that no view was found), and any routes have been
  defined in the configuration of your application, if the value of
  ``PATH_INFO`` does not already end in a slash, and if the value of
  ``PATH_INFO`` *plus* a slash matches any route's path, do an HTTP
  redirect to the slash-appended PATH_INFO.  Note that this will
  *lose* ``POST`` data information (turning it into a GET), so you
  shouldn't rely on this to redirect POST requests.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.location.lineage`` slightly.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.encode.urlencode`` (nee'
  ``repoze.bfg.url.urlencode``) slightly.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.traversal.model_path``.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.traversal.model_path_tuple`` slightly.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.traversal.traverse`` slightly.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.url.model_url`` slightly.

- Speed up ``repoze.bfg.url.route_url`` slightly.

- Sped up ``repoze.bfg.traversal.ModelGraphTraverser:__call__``
  slightly.

- Minor speedup of ``repoze.bfg.router.Router.__call__``.

- New ``repoze.bfg.exceptions`` module was created to house exceptions
  that were previously sprinkled through various modules.

Internal
--------

- Move ``repoze.bfg.traversal._url_quote`` into ``repoze.bfg.encode``
  as ``url_quote``.

Deprecations
------------

- The import of ``repoze.bfg.view.NotFound`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.NotFound``.  The old location still
  functions, but emits a deprecation warning.

- The import of ``repoze.bfg.security.Unauthorized`` is deprecated in
  favor of ``repoze.bfg.exceptions.Forbidden``.  The old location
  still functions but emits a deprecation warning.  The rename from
  ``Unauthorized`` to ``Forbidden`` brings parity to the the name of
  the exception and the system view it invokes when raised.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- We previously had a Unicode-aware wrapper for the
  ``urllib.urlencode`` function named ``repoze.bfg.url.urlencode``
  which delegated to the stdlib function, but which marshalled all
  unicode values to utf-8 strings before calling the stdlib version.
  A newer replacement now lives in ``repoze.bfg.encode`` The
  replacement does not delegate to the stdlib.

  The replacement diverges from the stdlib implementation and the
  previous ``repoze.bfg.url`` url implementation inasmuch as its
  ``doseq`` argument is now a decoy: it always behaves in the
  ``doseq=True`` way (which is the only sane behavior) for speed
  purposes.

  The old import location (``repoze.bfg.url.urlencode``) still
  functions and has not been deprecated.

- In 0.8a7, the return value expected from an object implementing
  ``ITraverserFactory`` was changed from a sequence of values to a
  dictionary containing the keys ``context``, ``view_name``,
  ``subpath``, ``traversed``, ``virtual_root``, ``virtual_root_path``,
  and ``root``.  Until now, old-style traversers which returned a
  sequence have continued to work but have generated a deprecation
  warning.  In this release, traversers which return a sequence
  instead of a dictionary will no longer work.

1.1a4 (2009-09-23)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- On 64-bit Linux systems, views that were members of a multiview
  (orderings of views with predicates) were not evaluated in the
  proper order.  Symptom: in a configuration that had two views with
  the same name but one with a ``request_method=POST`` predicate and
  one without, the one without the predicate would be called
  unconditionally (even if the request was a POST request).  Thanks
  much to Sebastien Douche for providing the buildbots that pointed
  this out.

Documentation
-------------

- Added a tutorial which explains how to use ``repoze.session``
  (ZODB-based sessions) in a ZODB-based repoze.bfg app.

- Added a tutorial which explains how to add ZEO to a ZODB-based
  ``repoze.bfg`` application.

- Added a tutorial which explains how to run a ``repoze.bfg``
  application under `mod_wsgi <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/>`_.
  See "Running a repoze.bfg Application under mod_wsgi" in the
  tutorials section of the documentation.

Features
--------

- Add a ``repoze.bfg.url.static_url`` API which is capable of
  generating URLs to static resources defined by the ``<static>`` ZCML
  directive.  See the "Views" narrative chapter's section titled
  "Generating Static Resource URLs" for more information.

- Add a ``string`` renderer.  This renderer converts a non-Response
  return value of any view callble into a string.  It is documented in
  the "Views" narrative chapter.

- Give the ``route`` ZCML directive the ``view_attr`` and
  ``view_renderer`` parameters (bring up to speed with 1.1a3
  features).  These can also be spelled as ``attr`` and ``renderer``.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- An object implementing the ``IRenderer`` interface (and
  ``ITemplateRenderer`, which is a subclass of ``IRenderer``) must now
  accept an extra ``system`` argument in its ``__call__`` method
  implementation.  Values computed by the system (as opposed to by the
  view) are passed by the system in the ``system`` parameter, which
  will always be a dictionary.  Keys in the dictionary include:
  ``view`` (the view object that returned the value),
  ``renderer_name`` (the template name or simple name of the
  renderer), ``context`` (the context object passed to the view), and
  ``request`` (the request object passed to the view).  Previously
  only ITemplateRenderers received system arguments as elements inside
  the main ``value`` dictionary.

Internal
--------

- The way ``bfg_view`` declarations are scanned for has been modified.
  This should have no external effects.

- Speed: do not register an ITraverserFactory in configure.zcml;
  instead rely on queryAdapter and a manual default to
  ModelGraphTraverser.

- Speed: do not register an IContextURL in configure.zcml; instead
  rely on queryAdapter and a manual default to TraversalContextURL.

- General speed microimprovements for helloworld benchmark: replace
  try/excepts with statements which use 'in' keyword.

1.1a3 (2009-09-16)
==================

Documentation
-------------

- The "Views" narrative chapter in the documentation has been updated
  extensively to discuss "renderers".

Features
--------

- A ``renderer`` attribute has been added to view configurations,
  replacing the previous (1.1a2) version's ``template`` attribute.  A
  "renderer" is an object which accepts the return value of a view and
  converts it to a string.  This includes, but is not limited to,
  templating systems.

- A new interface named ``IRenderer`` was added.  The existing
  interface, ``ITemplateRenderer`` now derives from this new
  interface.  This interface is internal.

- A new interface named ``IRendererFactory`` was added.  An existing
  interface named ``ITemplateRendererFactory`` now derives from this
  interface.  This interface is internal.

- The ``view`` attribute of the ``view`` ZCML directive is no longer
  required if the ZCML directive also has a ``renderer`` attribute.
  This is useful when the renderer is a template renderer and no names
  need be passed to the template at render time.

- A new zcml directive ``renderer`` has been added.  It is documented
  in the "Views" narrative chapter of the documentation.

- A ZCML ``view`` directive (and the associated ``bfg_view``
  decorator) can now accept a "wrapper" value.  If a "wrapper" value
  is supplied, it is the value of a separate view's *name* attribute.
  When a view with a ``wrapper`` attribute is rendered, the "inner"
  view is first rendered normally.  Its body is then attached to the
  request as "wrapped_body", and then a wrapper view name is looked up
  and rendered (using ``repoze.bfg.render_view_to_response``), passed
  the request and the context.  The wrapper view is assumed to do
  something sensible with ``request.wrapped_body``, usually inserting
  its structure into some other rendered template.  This feature makes
  it possible to specify (potentially nested) "owrap" relationships
  between views using only ZCML or decorators (as opposed always using
  ZPT METAL and analogues to wrap view renderings in outer wrappers).

Dependencies
------------

- When used under Python < 2.6, BFG now has an installation time
  dependency on the ``simplejson`` package.

Deprecations
------------

- The ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerDummyRenderer`` API has been
  deprecated in favor of
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerTemplateRenderer``.  A deprecation
  warning is *not* issued at import time for the former name; it will
  exist "forever"; its existence has been removed from the
  documentation, however.

- The ``repoze.bfg.templating.renderer_from_cache`` function has been
  moved to ``repoze.bfg.renderer.template_renderer_factory``.  This
  was never an API, but code in the wild was spotted that used it.  A
  deprecation warning is issued at import time for the former.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The ``ITemplateRenderer`` interface has been changed.  Previously
  its ``__call__`` method accepted ``**kw``.  It now accepts a single
  positional parameter named ``kw`` (REVISED: it accepts two
  positional parameters as of 1.1a4: ``value`` and ``system``).  This
  is mostly an internal change, but it was exposed in APIs in one
  place: if you've used the
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerDummyRenderer`` API in your tests with
  a custom "renderer" argument with your own renderer implementation,
  you will need to change that renderer implementation to accept
  ``kw`` instead of ``**kw`` in its ``__call__`` method (REVISED: make
  it accept ``value`` and ``system`` positional arguments as of 1.1a4).

- The ``ITemplateRendererFactory`` interface has been changed.
  Previously its ``__call__`` method accepted an ``auto_reload``
  keyword parameter.  Now its ``__call__`` method accepts no keyword
  parameters.  Renderers are now themselves responsible for
  determining details of auto-reload.  This is purely an internal
  change.  This interface was never external.

- The ``template_renderer`` ZCML directive introduced in 1.1a2 has
  been removed.  It has been replaced by the ``renderer`` directive.

- The previous release (1.1a2) added a view configuration attribute
  named ``template``.  In this release, the attribute has been renamed
  to ``renderer``.  This signifies that the attribute is more generic:
  it can now be not just a template name but any renderer name (ala
  ``json``).  

- In the previous release (1.1a2), the Chameleon text template
  renderer was used if the system didn't associate the ``template``
  view configuration value with a filename with a "known" extension.
  In this release, you must use a ``renderer`` attribute which is a
  path that ends with a ``.txt`` extension
  (e.g. ``templates/foo.txt``) to use the Chameleon text renderer.

1.1a2 (2009-09-14)
==================

Features
--------

- A ZCML ``view`` directive (and the associated ``bfg_view``
  decorator) can now accept an "attr" value.  If an "attr" value is
  supplied, it is considered a method named of the view object to be
  called when the response is required.  This is typically only good
  for views that are classes or instances (not so useful for
  functions, as functions typically have no methods other than
  ``__call__``).

- A ZCML ``view`` directive (and the associated ``bfg_view``
  decorator) can now accept a "template" value.  If a "template" value
  is supplied, and the view callable returns a dictionary, the
  associated template is rendered with the dictionary as keyword
  arguments.  See the section named "Views That Have a ``template``"
  in the "Views" narrative documentation chapter for more information.

1.1a1 (2009-09-06)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- "tests" module removed from the bfg_alchemy paster template; these
  tests didn't work.

- Bugfix: the ``discriminator`` for the ZCML "route" directive was
  incorrect.  It was possible to register two routes that collided
  without the system spitting out a ConfigurationConflictError at
  startup time.

Features
--------

- Feature addition: view predicates.  These are exposed as the
  ``request_method``, ``request_param``, and ``containment``
  attributes of a ZCML ``view`` declaration, or the respective
  arguments to a ``@bfg_view`` decorator.  View predicates can be used
  to register a view for a more precise set of environment parameters
  than was previously possible.  For example, you can register two
  views with the same ``name`` with different ``request_param``
  attributes.  If the ``request.params`` dict contains 'foo'
  (request_param="foo"), one view might be called; if it contains
  'bar' (request_param="bar"), another view might be called.
  ``request_param`` can also name a key/value pair ala ``foo=123``.
  This will match only when the ``foo`` key is in the request.params
  dict and it has the value '123'.  This particular example makes it
  possible to write separate view functions for different form
  submissions.  The other predicates, ``containment`` and
  ``request_method`` work similarly.  ``containment`` is a view
  predicate that will match only when the context's graph lineage has
  an object possessing a particular class or interface, for example.
  ``request_method`` is a view predicate that will match when the HTTP
  ``REQUEST_METHOD`` equals some string (eg. 'POST').

- The ``@bfg_view`` decorator now accepts three additional arguments:
  ``request_method``, ``request_param``, and ``containment``.
  ``request_method`` is used when you'd like the view to match only a
  request with a particular HTTP ``REQUEST_METHOD``; a string naming
  the ``REQUEST_METHOD`` can also be supplied as ``request_type`` for
  backwards compatibility.  ``request_param`` is used when you'd like
  a view to match only a request that contains a particular
  ``request.params`` key (with or without a value).  ``containment``
  is used when you'd like to match a request that has a context that
  has some class or interface in its graph lineage.  These are
  collectively known as "view predicates".

- The ``route`` ZCML directive now honors ``view_request_method``,
  ``view_request_param`` and ``view_containment`` attributes, which
  pass along these values to the associated view if any is provided.
  Additionally, the ``request_type`` attribute can now be spelled as
  ``view_request_type``, and ``permission`` can be spelled as
  ``view_permission``.  Any attribute which starts with ``view_`` can
  now be spelled without the ``view_`` prefix, so ``view_for`` can be
  spelled as ``for`` now, etc.  Both forms are documented in the
  urldispatch narraitve documentation chapter.

- The ``request_param`` ZCML view directive attribute (and its
  ``bfg_view`` decorator cousin) can now specify both a key and a
  value.  For example, ``request_param="foo=123"`` means that the foo
  key must have a value of ``123`` for the view to "match".

- Allow ``repoze.bfg.traversal.find_interface`` API to use a class
  object as the argument to compare against the ``model`` passed in.
  This means you can now do ``find_interface(model, SomeClass)`` and
  the first object which is found in the lineage which has
  ``SomeClass`` as its class (or the first object found which has
  ``SomeClass`` as any of its superclasses) will be returned.

- Added ``static`` ZCML directive which registers a route for a view
  that serves up files in a directory.  See the "Views" narrative
  documentation chapter's "Serving Static Resources Using a ZCML
  Directive" section for more information.

- The ``repoze.bfg.view.static`` class now accepts a string as its
  first argument ("root_dir") that represents a package-relative name
  e.g. ``somepackage:foo/bar/static``.  This is now the preferred
  mechanism for spelling package-relative static paths using this
  class.  A ``package_name`` keyword argument has been left around for
  backwards compatibility.  If it is supplied, it will be honored.

- The API ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerView`` now takes a
  ``permission`` argument.  Use this instead of using
  ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerViewPermission``.

- The ordering of route declarations vs. the ordering of view
  declarations that use a "route_name" in ZCML no longer matters.
  Previously it had been impossible to use a route_name from a route
  that had not yet been defined in ZCML (order-wise) within a "view"
  declaration.

- The repoze.bfg router now catches both
  ``repoze.bfg.security.Unauthorized`` and
  ``repoze.bfg.view.NotFound`` exceptions while rendering a view.
  When the router catches an ``Unauthorized``, it returns the
  registered forbidden view.  When the router catches a ``NotFound``,
  it returns the registered notfound view.

Internal
--------

- Change urldispatch internals: Route object is now constructed using
  a path, a name, and a factory instead of a name, a matcher, a
  generator, and a factory.

- Move (non-API) default_view, default_forbidden_view, and
  default_notfound_view functions into the ``repoze.bfg.view`` module
  (moved from ``repoze.bfg.router``).

- Removed ViewPermissionFactory from ``repoze.bfg.security``.  View
  permission checking is now done by registering and looking up an
  ISecuredView.

- The ``static`` ZCML directive now uses a custom root factory when
  constructing a route.

- The interface ``IRequestFactories`` was removed from the
  repoze.bfg.interfaces module.  This interface was never an API.

- The function named ``named_request_factories`` and the data
  structure named ``DEFAULT_REQUEST_FACTORIES`` have been removed from
  the ``repoze.bfg.request`` module.  These were never APIs.

- The ``IViewPermissionFactory`` interface has been removed.  This was
  never an API.

Documentation
-------------

- Request-only-convention examples in the "Views" narrative
  documentation were broken.

- Fixed documentation bugs related to forget and remember in security API
  docs.

- Fixed documentation for ``repoze.bfg.view.static`` (in narrative
  ``Views`` chapter).

Deprecations
------------

- The API ``repoze.bfg.testing.registerViewPermission`` has been
  deprecated.

Backwards Incompatibilities
---------------------------

- The interfaces ``IPOSTRequest``, ``IGETRequest``, ``IPUTRequest``,
  ``IDELETERequest``, and ``IHEADRequest`` have been removed from the
  ``repoze.bfg.interfaces`` module.  These were not documented as APIs
  post-1.0.  Instead of using one of these, use a ``request_method``
  ZCML attribute or ``request_method`` bfg_view decorator parameter
  containing an HTTP method name (one of ``GET``, ``POST``, ``HEAD``,
  ``PUT``, ``DELETE``) instead of one of these interfaces if you were
  using one explicitly.  Passing a string in the set (``GET``,
  ``HEAD``, ``PUT``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``) as a ``request_type``
  argument will work too.  Rationale: instead of relying on interfaces
  attached to the request object, BFG now uses a "view predicate" to
  determine the request type.

- Views registered without the help of the ZCML ``view`` directive are
  now responsible for performing their own authorization checking.

- The ``registry_manager`` backwards compatibility alias importable
  from "repoze.bfg.registry", deprecated since repoze.bfg 0.9 has been
  removed.  If you are tring to use the registry manager within a
  debug script of your own, use a combination of the
  "repoze.bfg.paster.get_app" and "repoze.bfg.scripting.get_root" APIs
  instead.

- The ``INotFoundAppFactory`` interface has been removed; it has
  been deprecated since repoze.bfg 0.9.  If you have something like
  the following in your ``configure.zcml``::

   <utility provides="repoze.bfg.interfaces.INotFoundAppFactory"
            component="helloworld.factories.notfound_app_factory"/>

  Replace it with something like::

   <notfound 
       view="helloworld.views.notfound_view"/>

  See "Changing the Not Found View" in the "Hooks" chapter of the
  documentation for more information.

- The ``IUnauthorizedAppFactory`` interface has been removed; it has
  been deprecated since repoze.bfg 0.9.  If you have something like
  the following in your ``configure.zcml``::

   <utility provides="repoze.bfg.interfaces.IUnauthorizedAppFactory"
            component="helloworld.factories.unauthorized_app_factory"/>

  Replace it with something like::

   <forbidden
       view="helloworld.views.forbidden_view"/>

  See "Changing the Forbidden View" in the "Hooks" chapter of the
  documentation for more information.

- ``ISecurityPolicy``-based security policies, deprecated since
  repoze.bfg 0.9, have been removed.  If you have something like this
  in your ``configure.zcml``, it will no longer work::

   <utility
     provides="repoze.bfg.interfaces.ISecurityPolicy"
     factory="repoze.bfg.security.RemoteUserInheritingACLSecurityPolicy"
     />

   If ZCML like the above exists in your application, you will receive
   an error at startup time.  Instead of the above, you'll need
   something like::

     <remoteuserauthenticationpolicy/>
     <aclauthorizationpolicy/>

   This is just an example.  See the "Security" chapter of the
   repoze.bfg documentation for more information about configuring
   security policies.

- Custom ZCML directives which register an authentication or
  authorization policy (ala "authtktauthenticationpolicy" or
  "aclauthorizationpolicy") should register the policy "eagerly" in
  the ZCML directive instead of from within a ZCML action.  If an
  authentication or authorization policy is not found in the component
  registry by the view machinery during deferred ZCML processing, view
  security will not work as expected.
