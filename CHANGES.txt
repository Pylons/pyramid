Next release
============

Bug Fixes
---------

- Forward port from 1.3 branch: When no authentication policy was configured,
  a call to ``pyramid.security.effective_principals`` would unconditionally
  return the empty list.  This was incorrect, it should have unconditionally
  returned ``[Everyone]``, and now does.

- Explicit url dispatch regexes can now contain colons.

- On at least one 64-bit Ubuntu system under Python 3.2, using the
  ``view_config`` decorator caused a ``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size
  during iteration`` exception.  It no longer does.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/635 for more information.

- In Mako Templates lookup, cyheck if the uri is already adjusted and bring
  it back to an asset spec. Normally occurs with inherited templates or
  included components.

- ``pserve``: don't show --stop-daemon option on Windows.

Features
--------

- Third-party custom view and route predicates can now be added for use by
  view authors via ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view_predicate`` and
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route_predicate``.  So, for example,
  doing this::

     config.add_view_predicate('abc', my.package.ABCPredicate)

  Might allow a view author to do this in an application that configured that
  predicate::

     @view_config(abc=1)

  See "Adding A Third Party View or Route Predicate" in the Hooks chapter for
  more information.

  Note that changes made to support the above feature now means that only
  actions registered using the same "order" can conflict with one another.
  It used to be the case that actions registered at different orders could
  potentially conflict, but to my knowledge nothing ever depended on this
  behavior (it was a bit silly).

- Custom objects can be made easily JSON-serializable in Pyramid by defining
  a ``__json__`` method on the object's class. This method should return
  values natively serializable by ``json.dumps`` (such as ints, lists,
  dictionaries, strings, and so forth).

- The JSON renderer now allows for the definition of custom type adapters to
  convert unknown objects to JSON serializations.

- As of this release, the ``request_method`` predicate, when used, will also
  imply that ``HEAD`` is implied when you use ``GET``.  For example, using
  ``@view_config(request_method='GET')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'HEAD'))``.  Using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'POST')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST')``.  This is because
  HEAD is a variant of GET that omits the body, and WebOb has special support
  to return an empty body when a HEAD is used.

- ``config.set_request_method`` has been introduced to support extending
  request objects with arbitrary callables. This method expands on the
  previous ``config.set_request_property`` by supporting methods as well as
  properties. This method now causes less code to be executed at
  request construction time than ``config.set_request_property`` in
  version 1.3.

- Don't add a ``?`` to URLs generated by ``request.resource_url`` if the
  ``query`` argument is provided but empty.

- Don't add a ``?`` to URLs generated by ``request.route_url`` if the
  ``_query`` argument is provided but empty.

- The static view machinery now raises (rather than returns) ``HTTPNotFound``
  and ``HTTPMovedPermanently`` exceptions, so these can be caught by the
  NotFound view (and other exception views).

- The mako renderer now accepts a def name and returns the template def
  result for the view being called. The uri format using an asset spec is
  package:path/to/template#defname.mako. The old way of returning a tuple
  from the view is supported for backward compatibility, ('defname', {}).

- When there is a predicate mismatch exception (seen when no view matches for
  a given request due to predicates not working), the exception now contains
  a textual description of the predicate which didn't match.

- An ``add_permission`` directive method was added to the Configurator.  This
  directive registers a free-standing permission introspectable into the
  Pyramid introspection system.  Frameworks built atop Pyramid can thus use
  the the ``permissions`` introspectable category data to build a
  comprehensive list of permissions supported by a running system.  Before
  this method was added, permissions were already registered in this
  introspectable category as a side effect of naming them in an ``add_view``
  call, this method just makes it possible to arrange for a permission to be
  put into the ``permissions`` introspectable category without naming it
  along with an associated view.  Here's an example of usage of
  ``add_permission``::

      config = Configurator()
      config.add_permission('view')

Deprecations
------------

- The ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_request_property`` has been
  documentation-deprecated.  The method remains usable but the more
  featureful ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_request_method`` should be
  used in its place (it has all of the same capabilities but can also extend
  the request object with methods).
