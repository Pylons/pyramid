Next release
============

Bug Fixes
---------

- Forward port from 1.3 branch: When no authentication policy was configured,
  a call to ``pyramid.security.effective_principals`` would unconditionally
  return the empty list.  This was incorrect, it should have unconditionally
  returned ``[Everyone]``, and now does.

- Request instances generated by ``pyramid.scripting.prepare()``,
  ``pyramid.scripting.get_root()`` and ``pyramid.paster.bootstrap()``
  will now get request properties which were configured via
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator.set_request_property()``.  Note that
  if an explicit request instance is passed in, the custom properties
  *will not* be added.

Features
--------

- Custom objects can be made easily JSON-serializable in Pyramid by defining
  a ``__json__`` method on the object's class. This method should return
  values natively serializable by ``json.dumps`` (such as ints, lists,
  dictionaries, strings, and so forth).

- As of this release, the ``request_method`` predicate, when used, will also
  imply that ``HEAD`` is implied when you use ``GET``.  For example, using
  ``@view_config(request_method='GET')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method='HEAD')``.  Using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'POST')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST')``.  This is because
  HEAD is a variant of GET that omits the body, and WebOb has special support
  to return an empty body when a HEAD is used.

- ``config.set_request_property`` now causes less code to be executed at
  request construction time.
