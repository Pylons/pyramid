==========

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

 - Following the Pyramid deprecation period (1.6 -> 1.8),
   daemon support for pserve has been removed. This includes removing the
   daemon commands (start, stop, restart, status) as well as the following
   arguments:
   --daemon --pid-file --log-file --monitor-restart --status --user --group
   --stop-daemon

   To run your server as a daemon you should use a process manager instead of
   pserve.

Features
--------

- Protect against session fixation attacks and leaking session data across
  privilege boundaries by ensuring that ``pyramid.security.remember`` and
  ``pyramid.security.forget`` invalidate the old session when a session factory
  has been configured. However, ensure that session data is kept intact when
  calling ``pyramid.security.remember()`` when the previous userid was either
  ``None`` or the same as the userid that is being remembered.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug in `proutes` such that it now shows the correct view when a class
  and `attr` is involved.
