1.8b1 (2017-01-17)
==================

Features
--------

- Added an ``override`` option to ``config.add_translation_dirs`` to allow
  later calls to place translation directories at a higher priority then
  earlier calls. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2902

Documentation Changes
---------------------

- Improve registry documentation to discuss uses as a component registry
  and as a dictionary. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2893

- Quick Tour, Quick Tutorial, and most other remaining documentation updated to
  use cookiecutters instead of pcreate and scaffolds.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2888 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2889

- Fix unittests in wiki2 to work without different dependencies between
  py2 and py3. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2899

- Update Windows documentation to track newer Python 3 improvements to the
  installer. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2900

- Updated the ``mod_wsgi`` tutorial to use cookiecutters and Apache 2.4+.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2901

1.8a1 (2016-12-25)
==================

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- Support for the ``IContextURL`` interface that was deprecated in Pyramid 1.3
  has been removed.  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2822

- Following the Pyramid deprecation period (1.6 -> 1.8),
  daemon support for pserve has been removed. This includes removing the
  daemon commands (start, stop, restart, status) as well as the following
  arguments: ``--daemon``, ``--pid-file``, ``--log-file``,
  ``--monitor-restart``, ``--status``, ``--user``, ``--group``,
  ``--stop-daemon``

  To run your server as a daemon you should use a process manager instead of
  pserve.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2615

- ``pcreate`` is now interactive by default. You will be prompted if a file
  already exists with different content. Previously if there were similar
  files it would silently skip them unless you specified ``--interactive``
  or ``--overwrite``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2775

- Removed undocumented argument ``cachebust_match`` from
  ``pyramid.static.static_view``. This argument was shipped accidentally
  in Pyramid 1.6. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2681

- Change static view to avoid setting the ``Content-Encoding`` response header
  to an encoding guessed using Python's ``mimetypes`` module. This was causing
  clients to decode the content of gzipped files when downloading them. The
  client would end up with a ``foo.txt.gz`` file on disk that was already
  decoded, thus should really be ``foo.txt``. Also, the ``Content-Encoding``
  should only have been used if the client itself broadcast support for the
  encoding via ``Accept-Encoding`` request headers.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2810

- Settings are no longer accessible as attributes on the settings object
  (e.g. ``request.registry.settings.foo``). This was deprecated in Pyramid 1.2.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2823

Features
--------

- Python 3.6 compatibility.
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/2835

- ``pcreate`` learned about ``--package-name`` to allow you to create a new
  project in an existing folder with a different package name than the project
  name. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2783

- The ``_get_credentials`` private method of ``BasicAuthAuthenticationPolicy``
  has been extracted into standalone function ``extract_http_basic_credentials``
  in ``pyramid.authentication`` module, this function extracts HTTP Basic
  credentials from a ``request`` object, and returns them as a named tuple.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2662

- Pyramid 1.4 silently dropped a feature of the configurator that has been
  restored. It's again possible for action discriminators to conflict across
  different action orders.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2757

- ``pyramid.paster.bootstrap`` and its sibling ``pyramid.scripting.prepare``
  can now be used as context managers to automatically invoke the ``closer``
  and pop threadlocals off of the stack to prevent memory leaks.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2760

- Added ``pyramid.config.Configurator.add_exception_view`` and the
  ``pyramid.view.exception_view_config`` decorator. It is now possible using
  these methods or via the new ``exception_only=True`` option to ``add_view``
  to add a view which will only be matched when handling an exception.
  Previously any exception views were also registered for a traversal
  context that inherited from the exception class which prevented any
  exception-only optimizations.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2660

- Added the ``exception_only`` boolean to
  ``pyramid.interfaces.IViewDeriverInfo`` which can be used by view derivers
  to determine if they are wrapping a view which only handles exceptions.
  This means that it is no longer necessary to perform request-time checks
  for ``request.exception`` to determine if the view is handling an exception
  - the pipeline can be optimized at config-time.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2660

- ``pserve`` should now work with ``gevent`` and other workers that need
  to monkeypatch the process, assuming the server and / or the app do so
  as soon as possible before importing the rest of pyramid.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2797

- Pyramid no longer copies the settings object passed to the
  ``pyramid.config.Configurator(settings=)``. The original ``dict`` is kept.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2823

- The csrf trusted origins setting may now be a whitespace-separated list of
  domains. Previously only a python list was allowed. Also, it can now be set
  using the ``PYRAMID_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`` environment variable similar to
  other settings. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2823

- ``pserve --reload`` now uses the
  `hupper <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/hupper/en/latest/>`
  library to monitor file changes. This comes with many improvements:

  - If the `watchdog <http://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/>`_ package is
    installed then monitoring will be done using inotify instead of
    cpu and disk-intensive polling.

  - The monitor is now a separate process that will not crash and starts up
    before any of your code.

  - The monitor will not restart the process after a crash until a file is
    saved.

  - The monitor works on windows.

  - You can now trigger a reload manually from a pyramid view or any other
    code via ``hupper.get_reloader().trigger_reload()``. Kind of neat.

  - You can trigger a reload by issuing a ``SIGHUP`` to the monitor process.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2805

- A new ``[pserve]`` section is supported in your config files with a
  ``watch_files`` key that can configure ``pserve --reload`` to monitor custom
  file paths. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2827

- Allow streaming responses to be made from subclasses of
  ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPException``. Previously the response would
  be unrolled while testing for a body, making it impossible to stream
  a response.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2863

- Update starter, alchemy and zodb scaffolds to support IPv6 by using the
  new ``listen`` directives in waitress.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2853

- All p* scripts now use argparse instead of optparse. This improves their
  ``--help`` output as well as enabling nicer documentation of their options.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2864

- Any deferred configuration action registered via ``config.action`` may now
  depend on threadlocal state, such as asset overrides, being active when
  the action is executed.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2873

- Asset specifications for directories passed to
  ``config.add_translation_dirs`` now support overriding the entire asset
  specification, including the folder name. Previously only the package name
  was supported and the folder would always need to have the same name.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2873

- ``config.begin()`` will propagate the current threadlocal request through
  as long as the registry is the same. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

     request = Request.blank(...)
     config.begin(request)  # pushes a request
     config.begin()         # propagates the previous request through unchanged
     assert get_current_request() is request

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2873

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug in ``proutes`` such that it now shows the correct view when a
  class and ``attr`` is involved.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2687

- Fix a ``FutureWarning`` in Python 3.5 when using ``re.split`` on the
  ``format`` setting to the ``proutes`` script.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2714

- Fix a ``RuntimeWarning`` emitted by WebOb when using arbitrary objects
  as the ``userid`` in the ``AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy``. This is now caught
  by the policy and the object is serialized as a base64 string to avoid
  the cryptic warning. Since the userid will be read back as a string on
  subsequent requests a more useful warning is emitted encouraging you to
  use a primitive type instead.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2715

- Pyramid 1.6 introduced the ability for an action to invoke another action.
  There was a bug in the way that ``config.add_view`` would interact with
  custom view derivers introduced in Pyramid 1.7 because the view's
  discriminator cannot be computed until view derivers and view predicates
  have been created in earlier orders. Invoking an action from another action
  would trigger an unrolling of the pipeline and would compute discriminators
  before they were ready. The new behavior respects the ``order`` of the action
  and ensures the discriminators are not computed until dependent actions
  from previous orders have executed.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2757

- Fix bug in i18n where the default domain would always use the Germanic plural
  style, even if a different plural function is defined in the relevant
  messages file. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2859

- The ``config.override_asset`` method now occurs during
  ``pyramid.config.PHASE1_CONFIG`` such that it is ordered to execute before
  any calls to ``config.add_translation_dirs``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2873

Deprecations
------------

- The ``pcreate`` script and related scaffolds have been deprecated in favor
  of the popular
  `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ project.

  All of Pyramid's official scaffolds as well as the tutorials have been
  ported to cookiecutters:

  - `pyramid-cookiecutter-starter
    <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-starter>`_

  - `pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy
    <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-alchemy>`_

  - `pyramid-cookiecutter-zodb
    <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid-cookiecutter-zodb>`_

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2780

- Clarify a possible misuse of the ``headers`` kwarg to subclasses of
  ``pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPException`` in which more appropriate
  kwargs from the parent class ``pyramid.response.Response`` should be
  used instead. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2750

- The SQLAlchemy + URL Dispatch + Jinja2 (``wiki2``) and
  ZODB + Traversal + Chameleon (``wiki``) tutorials have been updated to
  utilize the new cookiecutters and drop support for the ``pcreate``
  scaffolds.

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2881 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2883.
