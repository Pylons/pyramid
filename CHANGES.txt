Next release
============

Features (delta from BFG 1.3.X)
-------------------------------

- Mako templating renderer supports resource specification format for
  template lookups and within Mako templates. Absolute filenames must
  be used in Pyramid to avoid this lookup process.

- Add ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` module, which is a facade for the
  ``webob.exc`` module.

- Direct built-in support for the Mako templating language.

- A "squiggly" (Pylons-style) route syntax is now supported by
  ``pyramid.configuration.Configurator.add_route`` (and thus, by the
  ``route`` ZCML directive too).  For example, the following route
  patterns are equivalent: ``{foo}/{bar}`` and ``:foo/:bar``.  This is
  purely a syntactic affordance to make route patterns more tolerable
  for people coming from Pylons.

- A new configurator method exists: ``add_handler``.  This method adds
  a Pylons-style "view handler" (such a thing used to be called a
  "controller" in Pylons 1.0).

- New argument to configurator: ``session_factory``.

- New method on configurator: ``set_session_factory``

- Using ``request.session`` now returns a (dictionary-like) session
  object if a session factory has been configured.

- New module: ``pyramid.personality.pylons``: contains Pylons-specific
  features.

- The request now has a new attribute: ``tmpl_context`` for benefit of
  Pylons users.

- The decorator previously known as ``pyramid.view.bfg_view`` is now
  known most formally as ``pyramid.view.view_config`` in docs and
  paster templates.  An import of ``pyramid.view.bfg_view``, however,
  will continue to work "forever".

- New API methods in ``pyramid.session``: ``signed_serialize`` and
  ``signed_deserialize``.

- New interface: ``pyramid.interfaces.IRendererInfo``.  An object of this type
  is passed to renderer factory constructors (see "Backwards
  Incompatibilities").

- New event type: ``pyramid.interfaces.IBeforeRender``.  An object of this type
  is sent as an event before a renderer is invoked (but after the
  application-level renderer globals factory added via
  ``pyramid.configurator.configuration.set_renderer_globals_factory``, if any,
  has injected its own keys).  Applications may now subscribe to the
  ``IBeforeRender`` event type in order to introspect the and modify the set of
  renderer globals before they are passed to a renderer.  The event object
  iself has a dictionary-like interface that can be used for this purpose.  For
  example::

    from repoze.events import subscriber
    from pyramid.interfaces import IRendererGlobalsEvent

    @subscriber(IRendererGlobalsEvent)
    def add_global(event):
        event['mykey'] = 'foo'

  If a subscriber attempts to add a key that already exist in the renderer
  globals dictionary, a ``KeyError`` is raised.  This limitation is due to the
  fact that subscribers cannot be ordered relative to each other.  The set of
  keys added to the renderer globals dictionary by all subscribers and
  app-level globals factories must be unique.

- New class: ``pyramid.response.Response``.  This is a pure facade for
  ``webob.Response`` (old code need not change to use this facade, it's
  existence is mostly for vanity and documentation-generation purposes).

Documentation (delta from BFG 1.3)
-----------------------------------

- Added a ``pyramid.httpexceptions`` API documentation chapter.

- Added a ``pyramid.session`` API documentation chapter.

- Added a ``Session Objects`` narrative documentation chapter.

- Added an API chapter for the ``pyramid.personality`` module.

- Added an API chapter for the ``pyramid.response`` module.

- All documentation which previously referred to ``webob.Response`` now uses
  ``pyramid.response.Response`` instead.

- The documentation has been overhauled to use imperative configuration,
  moving declarative configuration (ZCML) explanations to a separate
  narrative chapter ``declarative.rst``.

Backwards Incompatibilities (with BFG 1.3.X)
--------------------------------------------

- There is no longer an ``IDebugLogger`` registered as a named utility
  with the name ``repoze.bfg.debug``.

- The logger which used to have the name of ``repoze.bfg.debug`` now
  has the name ``pyramid.debug``.

- The deprecated API ``pyramid.testing.registerViewPermission``
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.testing.registerRoutesMapper`` 
  has been removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.request.get_request`` was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.security.Unauthorized`` was
  removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.view_execution_permitted``
  was removed.

- The deprecated API named ``pyramid.view.NotFound`` was removed.

- The literal pattern ``{<anything>}`` is no longer permitted in route
  patterns (due to the addition of squiggly route pattern syntax
  support).

- The ``bfgshell`` paster command is now named ``pshell``.

- The Venusian "category" for all built-in Venusian decorators
  (e.g. ``subscriber`` and ``view_config``/``bfg_view``) is now
  ``pyramid`` instead of ``bfg``.

- ``pyramid.renderers.rendered_response`` function removed; use
  ``render_pyramid.renderers.render_to_response`` instead.

- Renderer factories now accept a *renderer info object* rather than an
  absolute resource specification or an absolute path.  The object has the
  following attributes: ``name`` (the ``renderer=`` value), ``package`` (the
  'current package' when the renderer configuration statement was found),
  ``type``: the renderer type, ``registry``: the current registry, and
  ``settings``: the deployment settings dictionary.

  Third-party ``repoze.bfg`` renderer implementations that must be ported to
  Pyramid will need to account for this.

  This change was made primarily to support more flexible Mako template
  rendering.

- The presence of the key ``repoze.bfg.message`` in the WSGI environment when
  an exception occurs is now deprecated.  Instead, code which relies on this
  environ value should use the ``exception`` attribute of the request
  (e.g. ``request.exception[0]``) to retrieve the message.

- The values ``bfg_localizer`` and ``bfg_locale_name`` kept on the request
  during internationalization for caching purposes were never APIs.  These
  however have changed to ``localizer`` and ``locale_name``, respectively.

- The default ``cookie_name`` value of the ``authtktauthenticationpolicy`` ZCML
  now defaults to ``auth_tkt`` (it used to default to ``repoze.bfg.auth_tkt``).

- The default ``cookie_name`` value of the
  ``pyramid.authentication.AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy`` constructor now
  defaults to ``auth_tkt`` (it used to default to ``repoze.bfg.auth_tkt``).

- All preexisting paster templates (except ``zodb``) now use "imperative"
  configuration (``starter``, ``routesalchemy``, ``alchemy``).

- A new paster template named ``pyramid_starter_zcml`` exists, which uses
  declarative configuration.
